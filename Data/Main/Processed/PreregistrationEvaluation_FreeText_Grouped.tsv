R_3plnOMmgE7iMu7b	In my experience, pre-registered studies are more work up-front: work that during my training I would have done during data analysis and writing. Some of this work affects the ideal study design, so it's better for that reason that it's earlier in the process. Additionally, I'm convinced it leads to better inference because of the interpretability of p-values. Finally, I feel it lends credibility to the eventual results and manuscripts. So: workflow is front-ended, but not overall more. Data management: because I expect others to see it, I use more reproducible methods and better code, and that probably helps me more than anyone. In terms of quality of research, I find it is higher, in general.	positive	improves credibility; improves overall quality		better inferences, more credible results, upfront workdload	- shifts work load - preregistration is not more time-consuming - better statistical inference - improves credibility - higher research quality - better datamangement (more reproducible)
R_3DvSlv5GdNsj3SO	I am a big proponent of pre-registration. But this year brought my first two Registered Report submissions and I was not in love with the process. The process introduced serious delays and invited reviewers to make comments/requests that would have never happened in a 'normal submission'. I will continue to pre-register my studies but will have to think more about when to do Registered Reports.	mixed	time-consuming	RRs need to be more effective	registered report is too much, prereg is good	- registered reports cause delays - preregistration is good
R_1ffQJOCPpdzJgLV	Speaking as someone who thinks various aspects of the field have improved because of preregistration, and as someone who has preregistered everything for a number of years (and plan to continue to do so): I struggle with its net value. I feel like my creativity and joy for research have suffered. Preregistration at times feels a lot like "teaching to the test." When I look at data, my mind goes right to "Was the preregistration right?" If not, it stings and I feel like the idea is done for. In past times I would have stuck with my thinking for a lot longer and explored the data for learning purposes, but now it feels like my only goal is to confirm the preregistration. I struggle with this.	negative	discourages exploration/creativity		restrictive, improves the field, frustrating 	- preregistration is good - creativity and joy suffered - less exploration of data - pressure to conform to the analysis plan
R_1nUR74ZBZaWBQK0	Duration has been longer for a paper I'm currently working on due to the analysis methods evolving over 3 studies. Without pre-reg (or certainly pre-reg of the first study) I probably would not have reported the analysis pre-registered for the first study. Time was not increased much for other projects.	negative	time-consuming		restrictive, can cause delay for projects with several studies	- preregistration causes delays - less exploration of alternative statistical methods - quality of inference suffered
R_1jK73BwMw1I74DI	Pre-registration prevents QRPs but also helps you flesh out the structure of your study a priori - helping you avoid common pitfalls	positive	improves credibility; improves overall quality		better structure, prevention of QRP	- preregistration improves credibility - preregistration improves project management
R_25NoLYxuWA3VTOp	n/a	-				-
R_3MbetgMtnNGrG16	I like preregistration. It's not much different from what most have to do as students: propose a study thoughtfully before doing it.	positive	improves overall quality		more thought trough	- preregistration improves credibility
R_3sW96KqkWew5Z7z	Pre-registration, though time consuming, enhance study design, creates greater consistency throughout the research process, and helps with clearer communication between collaborators.	mixed	harder, but worth it; improves collaboration		better communication between collaborators, better design, greater consistency	- preregistration is more time consuming - preregistration improves credibility - preregistration improves communication - preregistration improves project management
R_1MSBeMLSAin8ykF	I have no further thoughts	-			NA	-
R_OONo0QzgWL66Os1	this is really insightful work and hopefully helps improve attitudes about improving practices in the field. in subsequent work, it might be worth exploring how researchers felt pre-registration impacted the publication process. although i have been fortunate to have published a number of pre-registered studies at this point, i often encounter editors who still seem to want my team to change a priori aspects of manuscripts to better fit with a "we knew it all along" or in the context of competing hypothesis situations, favor the hypothesis that was ultimately supported by the data. in other words, pre-registration has improved the quality of my empirical work, but has created new challenges when interacting with journals and the publication process.	mixed	improves credibility; makes publishing harder		issues with acceptance of the method from all members of the scientific ecosystem	- preregistration improves credibility  - suggestions for future projects - problems with publishing preregistration
R_1pYASbK3bjsXvKp	Whilr pre-registration can be time-consuming, most of the work are things that you have to do eventually anyways. Thus, the work simply moves to a different time point rather than actually increasing much.	mixed	harder, but worth it		shifts workload	- preregistration is not more time-consuming - shifts work-load
R_2xJmhjUP02hedVr	I am highly in favor of preregistration to reduce bias and improve experimental validity.  My field (animal research) is substantially behind the curve.  To date, of the preregistered studies I have attempted to publish, no reviewer has commented on the preregistration as a positive aspect of the study (the link is always included in the abstract and the methods).  Rather, the reviewers who have mentioned it have used the preregistration to point out deviations (which we take care to explicitly point out in the methods) and thus has led to more challenges with publication rather than fewer.  I am of the opinion that if I had submitted identical studies without preregistration, they would have been easier to publish.  I am hopeful that reviewers will realize the importance of preregistration and use it as an incentive rather than a punishment in the future.  Continued focus on the usefulness and importance of preregistration will hopefully move the field in the right direction.	mixed	improves credibility; inequality; makes publishing harder		it is useful, but would be more effective if reviers would be more open about it	- preregistration increases credibility - problems with publishing preregistration - pressure to adhere to analysis plan
R_1dtXMdQ00D46aVh	Good luck with the project!	-			NA	-
R_12uqK3Rvux40zKJ	I personally found that pre-registration was an excellent way to 'fight back' against pressures from supervisors/more senior co-authors to basically p-hack. However, this also caused friction and difficulty in the working relationship.	mixed	improves credibility; problems with collaborators		helps with hierarchical unbalance?	- preregistration improves credibility - preregistration prevents QRPs and pressure to p-hack - preregistration might cause frictions with supervisors/collaborators
R_bvYnlmq5WVg3e1z	good luck with this, best	-			NA	-
R_1FQzSzUeqBxJnyM	I have changed my practices over the last two years, so that nearly everything I do is pre-registered (with the exception of stuff that is much more pilot-like or involves a new analysis/method that I don't yet feel confident enough to pre-reg). But, I have worked with a couple of older datasets recently which have taken a long time to come in, and where the analyses have not been pre-registered. I must say,  the analysis process for studies that are not pre-registered is far less enjoyable and far more anxiety inducing. It now feels completely wrong and uncomfortable to 'make decisions as you go'.	positive	improves credibility		less frustration with preregstration because choices were made before	- more joy when preregistered - preregistration is less anxiety producing
R_ys6uTVWL9cnvA0p	Bit confusing that the scale points flipped (e.g. on this page "always" being totally on the left for the first question and "very strongly agree" being totally on the right for the second question) this may be done to make sure people are paying attention (like the two equals two question)but is not so convenient as a participant	-			NA	-
R_qDsLgbLul4GHRHr	Our lab is co-directed by two PIs, one who is a senior researcher who has adopted preregistration and the other (me) who is early mid-career but relatively new to, and not formally trained in, empirical work (long story)so is learning open science practices simultaneously with learning to do empirical work, which makes for an interesting lab. Of course the RA and postdocs are somewhere in between--prior to joining our lab, they had never preregistered but are formally trained in, and have prior experience with, empirical research (though of course not nearly as much as the senior PI). The modest time and stress increase has been due to complex questions about whether/how to preregister exploratory (as opposed to hypothesis-confirming) studies and also what it means to preregister a hypothesisâ€”does it mean that you are simply testing a hypothesis, and if you find a null effect that's fine, or does it mean you are somehow betting on a certain answer, and if you find a different answer that is bad for the publishability of your research. The two questions tend to intersect, inasmuch as those in the lab (e.g., senior PI) who view hypothesis testing as making a bet are probably more likely to deem studies exploratory until they feel confident in that bet, whereas those in the lab (e.g., me) who feel preregistering a hypothesis doesn't necessarily mean you believe the hypothesis will bear itself out, just that you want to know the answer to this specific question, as more like to deem studies hypothesis-confirming earlier. As the baby scientist, I am probably wrong and confused. Anyway, we typically preregister even exploratory research at this point.	mixed	harder, but worth it; not enough knowledge		no clear guidelines about what to preregestire and how	- preregistration stimulates new questions (e.g., how to deal with exploratory stuff) - preregistration increases quality of work
R_ZDeqJpCyQdzXCkV	I am happy to see someone collecting data on this. I think that there are a lot of misconceptions about preregistration among those who do not use it, so I hope that this data helps address some of that. I feel that preregistration has dramatically improved the quality of my work.	positive	improves overall quality		prereg good	
R_DwtEbxWL3a48DEl	I feel strongly that the field needs a clearer distinction between confirmatory and exploratory work, and wider recognition of the value of exploratory, descriptive research that can form the basis for well-specified hypotheses. So while I endorse pre-registration for all confirmatory research, I also recommend we all spend more time and effort on exploration before jumping to confirmation.	positive	inequality		distinction between exploratory and confirmatory, we should put more emphasis on exploratory	- preregistration improves credibility - exploratory research should be endorsed more frequently
R_qwnVGMW7vCoIqdP	Pre-registration has helped me get some studies published.  It also adds some stress because sometimes I might have two or more different ways I expect data to turn out, and sometimes the ideal way to analyze data doesn't come to me until I see it.  But in the end, it helped and I should objectively do it more.	mixed	makes publishing easier		prereg gets studies published, stress inducing, premade choices can be restrictiv during analysis	- preregistration helps with publishing - increased pressure to adhere to analysis plan
R_3hxZ2Vcew9Z3UW5	You should differentiate between self-made preregistration and Registered Reports	-			NA	- 
R_1LjBBWs6gG3N0VH	Confusing questions--are you asking about 1 specific experience with pre-reg or the average over all of them?  I've used pre-registration in different fields/topics and the experience is not the same.	mixed	inequality		different experience with prereg on different fields	- experience with preregistration is different across fields
R_23eiIOJa7SaOcVw	yay pre-registration!	positive			prereg good	- preregistration is good
R_32W56gsmex6DLzm	I preregistered a systematic review in a controversial area (gaming disorder). It was rejected from 4 journals until I asked for it to be reviewed by methods specialists. It seems the rigor of studies conducted in line with their preregistered reviews might be underappreciated.	negative	makes publishing harder; inequality		issues with publishing preregistered studies	- problems with publishing preregistration 
R_28RMvNLmUHA7YEV	Thanks for the study, it was mostly clear and easy to complete. My only suggestion -- if it even matters for your research question -- is to distinguish between "preregistered studies that are not published but I intend to publish" and "preregistered studies that are not published and I do not intend to publish." The very first question asking about the types of preregistration/registered reports we had only asked about having "preregistered studies that I have not published" and that captures both those who intend to publish it (e.g., I preregistered it and in the midst of data collection/analysis/writing) and those who do not (i.e., those who would be willing to admit to file-drawering). Again, I'm not sure if it matters, but those seem like two very different kinds of people.	-			NA	- suggestions for improvement
R_UtBQnLVoapyC0W5	More and more in my lab we are moving toward starting each new study with an exploratory, non-pre-registered sample, to be followed up if interesting with a confirmatory, pre-registered sample. I would actually NOT recommend pre-registering initial studies, and lean against pre-registering even follow-up studies prior to collecting an exploratory sample, as resources allow.	mixed	discourages exploration/creativity		preregistration is good if there is a prior exploratory study	- preregistration is good - exploratory studies are important and should preceed preregistrations
R_1rluGPuMzHJEKHs	We preregister all of our studies, regardless of the specificity of the hypotheses and/or research questions.	positive			prereg good	- preregistration is good
R_7O68rTnwpihaTUR	For me, the registered report process was surprisingly long (to the point that I had to change the student working on it, as the original one left the lab already). I think journals must expedite this process as much as possible to make it viable.	negative	time-consuming	journals need to make RR review more efficient	registered report too long	- Registered Reports are time-consuming - problems with publishing preregistrations
R_28Am0V4yAFUZCK3	I mostly like preregistration to be able to see what researchers predicted beforehand and how they would test this (and I suppose others like that too - that is why I preregister)	positive	improves credibility		credbility improvement	- preregistration imporves credibility
R_2Y5rttcNqfzrDmh	Somehow, it feels as if the questions in this survey miss the point of registrations. Or maybe I just realised that registrations are not as powerful as I thought so far... I'm looking forward to the results of this study.  Also, I don't know if you can "anonymise" anything, but rather aggregate or "pseudonymise"? Just a thought on the wording.	-			NA	-
R_2amXG7udUh35vJq	A major consequence of preregistration has been to increase sample sizes.	-			increased sample sizes	- preregistration led to higher sample sizes
R_2Bzi3UwteDnUVg6	Having the In Principle Acceptance and knowing that your results will be published regardless of the results, and knowing that you don't need to touch the introduction and methods part again was very liberating.	positive	makes publishing easier		registered reports are liberating	- Registered Reports reduce pressure (IPA)
R_2QtYRaJcbQFcnIS	It would have been better if you have given a clearer definition of "preregistered study" and "registered report" at the beginning of the survey.	-			NA	- suggestions for improvement
R_2TvfevvUaXHQnFE	I am very excited about all open science practices and hope to encourage others to participate. Additionally, I look forward to new processes to make this easier for everyone to implement.	positive		open science practices need to become easier to implement	prereg good, not easy fpr everyone to implement	- preregistration is good - preregistration should be easier to implement

R_ukwh5Yz8FlgrVvP	The questions on the previous page would've been easier to interpret if you had asked if those things had ever happened, or ask about what usually happens. And which scale anchors were on the left or right were sometimes confusing/surprising across questions.	-			NA	- suggestions for improvement
R_27DQQy60GkzSXzM	Preregistration is helpful but we must remember that it is not a panacea	mixed	does not address real issue		perereg good, not good for everything	- preregistration is good - preregistration is not a panacea
R_vH289TqtwvXNQfD	Open science practices (including but not limited to preregistration) helped me get my current faculty job. For younger researchers who may worry that the extra effort and time will delay their career progress, I feel it is important that they know how much open science practices are increasingly valued by hiring committees.	positive	advances career		better for hiring, valued	- preregistration/OS helped to get a job - preregistration is good
R_1JFRANFOfFT1gD9	it helps us recognize what decisions need to be made. There were a few moments where it required me to do much more work for very little gain, but it also prohibited me to complete sloppy work.	positive	harder, but worth it		decision points more clear, increases credibility	- shifts work load - preregistration increases credibility
R_21agB31b9EVmLGP	After what I've seen in my field, I don't trust any research that isn't preregistered. And I don't trust any research who pushes back against preregistration.	positive	improves credibility		increase trust	- preregistration increases credibility
R_1rp2Bgt6xrvGjf3	Generally speaking, preregistration is a good idea. However, what really Needs to Change is the attitude of Researchers and the community. If everyone is focused on Publishing as much as possible, because Publishing as much as possible is the precondition for an academic Career, introducing preregistrations is not enough. It is so easy to Register different plans for the same study and to remain silent About that. Of Course this is not the Right Thing to do, but the same People who used questionable Research practices before, will easily find ways to transform preregistrations into a questionable (or at least worthless) Research practice. In case this happened, however, a collective expectation that one preregisters one's studies would only be a bureaucratic burden for "honest" Researchers and not a way of stopping questionable Research practices.	mixed	does not address real issue		do not prevent QRPS	- preregistration is good - preregistration does not prevent QRPs 
R_30qo0Lbl91jAP0m	I find pre-registration very helpful for myself. Currently I have only done it for lab studies and not for field studies, although I plan it in the future.	positive			useful	- preregistration is good
R_10HEBo3owVlU3yI	Possibly, it is not a good idea to ask to check "4" in the attention test - it corresponds to "not changed" in the previous questions... It is sometimes difficult/impossible to follow the preregistered method of data analysis - a more flexible approach is usually necessary. My Results have usually two parts - the confirmatory part (which follows the preregistered protocol) and the exploratory part (which uses the methods more appropriate for the obtained data).	mixed	problems with exploration/adherence		hard to follow analysis plan, easier to make distinction between exploratory and confirmatory	- adherence to the preregistration plan is difficult 
R_24kJ3nxc8jjzVzo	Pre-registration makes you probably spent way more time at the initial steps of your research to write the pre-registration document, before you start collecting data. However, it can save a lot of time once you write the paper because you already have a good amount of work ready in your preregistration.  The only thing that refrain me to preregister all my studies, is that I am an associate professor in a country in which English is not the first language of my students. So not all of them are able to write a pre-registration for their study. I am considering still ask them to write a pre-registration in their first language, but I am worried that reviewers may not accept it as a real pre-registration.	mixed	harder, but worth it; inequality		shifted workload, is prereg in not english still a valid prereg?	- preregisration shifts work load - language could be a burden (students who write prereg in their first language) 
R_3k6OrypK6J2aphC	Pre-registration helped me as a protection from bad practices that my superiors have (and expect me to have). As a PhD candidate it's not easy, but everyday I get less resistance, although I couldn't convince them to make a RR. I also try to teach OS to my colleagues, and some (a few) get excited, but most are still seeing pre-registration as a complication. I hope this will change over time	mixed	improves credibility; problems with collaborators		increase credibility	- preregistration prevents QRPs - there is pushback from supervisors

R_3IVwjbFoO3WUblv	I have completed one pre-registered study at the request of reviewers (they wanted me to complete a pre-registered replication for some of my experiment results). So, this study was not necessarily a normal example of a pre-registered report (since it was done post-hoc).	-			na	-
R_W34dzkzc6gwyDq9	Pre-registration is still not really recognised in the field of IO and especially not when you are in an interesction to computer science - they don't know what this is and why someone should do it. Additionally, reporting everything that is preregistered has the downside that the papers tend to get longer which is an issue for some journals with word limits. Plus: reviewers sometimes have even criticized that I report non-significant results	negative	inequality; makes publishing harder		more time, push-back from reviewers	- preregsitration not known in computer science - preregsitration hinder publishing (word limit) - pushback from reviewers (non-significant findings)
R_78spwG70v7kWUKd	Thank you for doing this study!	-			na	-
R_3F5640qxxeNi4DI	Some aspect of open science that I think could use more standardization:  1) Organization of repository pages so that readers can figure out how to navigate the files without having to contact the author. E.g., READMEs that are as detailed as the ones you might find on good github pages. 2) How to report deviations from pre-registered protocols. 3) Having a pre-registration, open materials, and open data without compromising blind review.	mixed		- repositories need more organisation (better readme files) - need guidelines for deviations - how to deal with blind review	more tools and guidelines on how to do prereg properly	suggestions for improvements: - repositories need more organisation - need guidelines for deviations - how to deal with blind review 
R_2rIUJVnxbq6eVIC	I found it stressful waiting for input from collaborators when data collection was due to start imminently (e.g., if the school holidays were approaching and I needed to collect child data at that point). In terms of supervision, it gave me much more work up front at the beginning of the project, but then at the end it was very quick between end of data collection and publication. I think the pre-registration process may have made the review process easier, but I don't have evidence for that!	mixed	harder, but worth it; makes publishing easier		shifted workload, time management for project has to be different, easier review process	- preregistration can be stressful (if there are fixed dates for data collection) - preregistration shifts work load - preregistration makes review process easier
R_3HA1cZPmL96IO4p	Because of the nature of my research approach (experiments) it has been natural to adopt the pre-registration approach. With explorative studies, for example test development, it is less straightforward.	mixed	inequality		prereg good for experimental	- preregistration is easy for experiments, but not for other research designs (exploratory studies or test development)
R_30jJXkpehIS49Uf	I'm agnostic about pre-registration. I do it because it seems like where the field is headed.	mixed	advances career		agnostic	- preregistration is good
R_30ocXWNw0JXXC7N	I truly believe that preregistration is an extremely useful process that generates more reliable research. It will become even more useful when new templates emerge for non-hypothesis testing research.	positive	improves credibility	- need more templates	prereg good, increase reliability, templates for exploratory are needed	- preregistration improves credibility suggestion for improvement: - more templates
R_3kMyrueij7LZ7Fb	The phrase "got more thought-through" from the previous page is very awkward. This survey would benefit from improved wording on those questions.	-			na	- 
R_p6r28kGJZiGPvdT	I agree with the idea of pre-registrations. For a couple of years I pre-register all the studies, where I am the PI. At the same time, I have concerns regarding too much of ideology and judgmental evaluations related to pre-registrations and open science. It seems to me that at times it is too much of "if you don't do it, then you are a bad scientist/person". Once I have been asked by a reviewer to explain why I haven't pre-registered studies (they were conducted a few years ago) and was suggested that it seems like malpractice. I know that the idea is that we should not have to trust one another (and ourselves), hence pre-registration is a transparent tool. I agree and at the same time lack of pre-registration should not be punished. I believe it is better to reward for good practice, rather than do witch-hunting. I also do not know why at aspredicted.org there was (or is) a new thing that an automatic message pops in when there are two similar pre-registrations and asks you to explain yourself (among others: to state that there is no data point shared between the two pre-registrations). I also do not know how come aspredicted.org was doing the analysis of the pre-registrations and what happens with the answer that one provides. I thought that the page just stores information and the researcher is the only one that decides on this data. I understand that there is a risk that people will pre-register two, contradictory hypothesis and this is why such a message appears in case of similar pre-registrations. Up to which point the idea of pre-registration and open science is to go chasing scientists and suspect the worse? I mean, if somebody wants to behave dishonestly, they will (they can pre-register at two different sites). So, again, I think it is better to work and motivate with rewards, rather than with fear and punishment.  Taken together, I am still in favor of pre-registration and open science and I plan to pre-register the studies that I lead. At the same time, I wish that the movement was more moderate and based more on positive reinforcement.	mixed	stigmatization	better to reward researchers than to punish them	prereg good, better to reward if it exist than punish if it does not, it all depends on the honesty of the researcher	- preregistration is good - better to reward researchers, then to punish  - OS people put a stigma on researchers that do not preregister - preregistration cannot prevent QRPs - aspredicted is too controlling (checks whether there are similar preregs out there)  
R_3LchwyuxUv7HfTH	I think pre-registration is great for my work. I do not always have time to go through the formal process with student projects which are on a short timeline.	positive	harder, but worth it		good, needs more time	- preregistration is good - preregistration is difficult for student projects because of time constraints - preregistration is more time-consuming
R_2tL1FplOL20yA2u	Many of my colleagues say that they do not have time to preregister. It should be part of the work ethics. They should make time to be considered researchers.	positive	harder, but worth it		prereg good, some researcher think prereg takes more time	- preregistration is good - preregistration is more time-consuming
R_2dtNE75Zrq4mZJY	At this point, although I find the pre-registration process helpful for teaching students and thinking through designs, I feel pre-registration is more of a slight liability than an advantage for publishing in my field	mixed	makes publishing harder		harder to publish, good tool for teaching	- preregistration good for teaching - preregistratin makes publishing more difficult
R_Q3PjJyMetbdGALv	In my field we ask very clear hypothesis driven questions and replicate our studies frequently. I will run registered reports only because it has become a standard in psychology, not because I believe it would improve my research in any meaningful way, I know that this is not the case in other labs or sub-fields in psychology, but reviewers do not always differentiate between which research question would benefit from pre-registration.	mixed	stigmatization		no meaningful change because of it but prerg is becoming a standard	- OS people do not differentiate enough which study is preregistered
R_6stmvjaMbL97rZ7	I strongly recommend preregistration with a special attention to ethical issues (such as anonymity). I believe that preregistering the theoretical background, hypothesis, data analysis methods, outliers management, power estimation (a priori) are very important and improve the quality of scientific research. It is time consuming and not always easy to achieve but when it is done you might regain the time spent before in the data management and publication process after.	positive	harder, but worth it; makes publishing easier		prereg good, better quality, time consuming, workload shift	- more ethical debates (anonymity) - preregistration is more time consuming
R_6gRi3xYoRMVrUQ1	Preregistration is like the IRB; a well-intended attempt to solve a real problem (research SHOULD be ethical! research SHOULD be rigorous!) that in the end only adds more pointless bureaucracy without actually achieving its intended purpose. Does anyone actually think the IRB actually makes social science research more ethical? Or does it just add increasing administrative paperwork and bureaucratic hoops (at best) and active attempts by IRBâ€™s to overreach and suppress research (at worst)? Preregistration is the same. The intention is good. In practice itâ€™s a lot of time, and bureaucratic paperwork, with little obvious payoff - see for instance recent papers showing almost all papers deviate from the preregistration, often without disclosing. Itâ€™s ironic that psychologists came up with such an inefficient bureaucratic poorly thought out administrative solution to whatâ€™s really a scientific problem. And I say this as someone who has extensive experience with preregistration and open science - Iâ€™ll try any proposed reforms, I have an open mind. This one just isnâ€™t good or feasible or helpful.	negative	harder, not worth it; problems with exploration/adherence		prereg do not offer real solution but bureaucracy	- preregistration creates more work without adding much value - preregistration is more time consuming  - more reforms/developments needed for preregistrations
R_BXGa3YnrcDdFp3H	In my field, a large share of research is exploratory. I find pre-registration much less relevant than in fields that are primarily experiment and confirmatory.	negative	inequality		not too relevant for exploratory	- preregistration not relevant in all fields (e.g., exploratory studd)
R_T4KU5hayr0KqqGd	One of the things I don't think these questions capture is different practices/thoughts about primary data collected by a PI and secondary data analysis of publicly-available data.	-			na	?
R_PByR9j96rbswu7D	I'm afraid I think reregistration is a complete waste of time. It was thought up in a state of paranoia and utter distrust of one's colleagues by people who actually dont understand how real research is actually done, and largely do trivial research. It is based on the incredibly naive view that psychology and the behavioural sciences have strong theory where real predictions can actually be made. They simply dont. Predictions act merely as scapels to help thinking through data in the search for explanations. The most important heuristic feature of research is when your prediction fails because that tells you when you havent really understood how the world works [cf Popper]. At that point, you need to burrow into your data like a terrier to try to figure out what was happening. Preregistration discourages that. It is a sticking plaster for a non-problem and is more likely to impede the growth rather than promote it. It is a pure Emperor's New Clothes phenomenon that has created an illusion of "science".	negative	does not address real issue; stigmatization		preregistration is not good for a field ith not clear predicitions	- preregistration prevents exploratory work  - preregistration is not good
R_1mUUriJcvEUHLca	I my opinion pregistration did not change research practices by people at all beside the fact that it now an additional step you often have to take which increases the workload even more.	negative	harder, not worth it		just more work	- preregistration does not prevent QRPs - preregistration is more work
R_3n1P9Vz6f3AeJss	The value of pre-registration seems to be highest for experiments study designs and more generally for study designs that do not require much data management & building up more complex models. So RCT-style studies should definitely incorporate preregistration as they have done in medical sciences. But I haven't yet seen the value of pre-registration for secondary data analysis or more generally for studies in which you have to examine the structure of the data and variables before you know whether it is feasible to fit more complex statistical models besides ANOVA. Sure, you can include the preliminary analysis in the pre-registration but what's the added value of such pre-registration? And how possible is it to, for instance, to submit the analysis code for such a project already in the pre-registration phase -- this would require skills of clairvoyance from the researchers. Or the researchers would have to carry our research with blinders on, leaving some important aspects of the data unchecked. Also, I am not eager to add pre-registration to the administrative burden that already includes writing research proposals, navigating manuscript submission portals, correctly formatting manuscripts, seeking IRB approval, submitting pre-prints etc. Pre-registration should be developed so that it considers all kinds of relevant psychological research. Otherwise it ends up glorifying some study designs at the expense of others that do not fit the experimental study protocols that are driving the pre-registration idea.	mixed	problems with exploration/adherence; harder, not worth it		not that useful for secondary data analysis, harder for studies with complex data preprocessing and analytical structure	- preregistration not suitable for designs that require data management or building on complex models - preregistration is more work - preregistration discourages exploratory studies
R_wLDde3ZxuDHYHIJ	Obviously pre-registration can't make things less though through. However, given that I usually replicate my results, at least conceptually, ~2 time per study, I somewhat resent that reviewers now suggest that studies that are not pre-registered are somehow less trustworthy...	mixed	stigmatization		there are other ways to increase credibility	- reviewers put a stigma to non-preregistrered studies

R_3qy9KSXFuKWs2GM	Duration was longer because of the added peer-review in a Registered Report context, assuming that a normal article gets published after 2 rounds of peer-review. Also for normal preregs, it might get slightly longer as one spends more time in the starting phase.	negative	time-consuming		registered reports are time consuming	- preregistration is more time consuming
R_3Ic3lUmtv5i8DsC	I am a bit skeptical of preregistration. My impression from other fields is that they just pre register every hypothesis they have and game the system. I'm not sure how honest it is making people who otherwise in the old system would not have been honest.	negative	does not address real issue		credibility is based on the researcher and not the prereg	- preregistration does not prevent QRPs 
R_2TBtVcuAQqO4CYW	I think pre-registration is really suitable for some designs, especially when doing highly experimental, controlled work and when using new methods/materials. Most of my work is quasi-experimental (although some is basic experimental and some is qualitative) so we just don't often have the control we would need to follow through with recommendations made at pre-reg. Also, more than half my work is with industry, which means that sometimes research questions have to be modified partway through because availability/accessibility changes, etc.  Finally, the speed at which our institutions expect us to pump through graduate students often means that pre-reg cannot happen for their work (and most of my work is student-led). In sum, I would very much like to pre-register some studies but circumstances haven't lent themselves to it for me. I don't think that not pre-registering should be frowned upon, nor does it mean that the quality of the work will be less. At the same time, I support the pre-reg movement and I am happy that it is an option.	mixed	time-consuming; inequality		prereg is good but not feasible in every case	- preregistration is good, but:  - preregistration not suited for all designs - preregistration is not suited in all fields (or in industry) - preregistration is more time consuming
R_22qW59kfasjJngi	Might be helpful to list your university affiliations in the recruitment email. I googled some of you just to make sure it wasn't spam, then completed it. Might also be helpful to define Research Report or other terms on the first page of the survey.  Thanks for collecting the data - looks very interesting.	-			na	-
R_2XjKQ4yT20kTSDU	I pre-register all empirical experiments that I run, but it is more difficult to use pre-registration when conducting a large longitudinal couples study in which I will be able to test many research ideas and hypotheses, some of which are already fleshed out, but others may develop later. My strategy so far has been to conceptually replicate findings from such ecologically large-scale studies in another similar study, and with preregistered experimental studies (which has been received well by journal editors and reviewers). To me, preregistration itself is not the holy grail (I think that replication more generally might be most important), but it's an extremely useful tool to guide the research process and practices.	mixed	improves overall quality; problems with exploration/adherence		prereg good, harder for longitudinal	- preregistration not suitable for all designs - preregistration does not solve all problems
R_3JLrwrm0vBqFUCz	I think preregistration is useful for quality control within the lab. I actually think it often impairs the publication and reporting process and results in papers that are less effective and less useful.	positive	improves overall quality		better credibility less novelty	- preregistration improves credibility - preregistration decreases the quality of the manuscripts

R_3OjJnfFqkmgWLR8	Preregistration is a fashionable topic to resolve issues, which cannot be resolved by it due their methodological nature (e.g. problems with sample size). Preregistration is meaningful in pharmaceutical experiments, where a national/international agency has full control over the research project, because it can guarantee that the project is not conducted without its permission. In the case of basic research preregistration can be repeated several times via different applications or it can be pretended that the subject of subsequent preregistered studies (coming from the same lab) are different when only the same experiment is "polished". E.g. one can "preregister" a study _again_ after she/he increased the sample size changed the data analysis etc, pretending that it is a new study. Or one can "preregesiter" a study after she/he finished it.  On the other hand, preregistration of studies threaten researcher autonomy, since it is methodologically and statistically sound and valid to run _exploratory_ studies, or to run a second experiment based on the results of a previous one to check the validity of the effect of the latter. Therefore, preregistration can induce the false belief in readers that a study is well conducted, however there is extremely easy to cheat in this process, while it disables or slows true exploratory research down, while decreasing researcher creativity. Moreover, it does not solve the basic issues, which are the consequence of the lack of basic methodological knowledge. In a nutshell: preregistration is a wrong answer and even worse practice to a good question.	negative	does not address real issue; problems with exploration/adherence; discourages exploration/creativity		you can stil cheat with prereg	- preregistration does not prevent QRPs - preregistration discourages exploratory research - preregistration does not solve methodological issues

R_QbnBhTDDADKHmgh	I fully subscribe to improving science's standards and transparency. Hence, why I engage in pre-registration usually. Of course it is important to improve the behaviour of the individual scientist. However, unless we rid science from the publication for-profit industry and educate our universities not to use the incentive structure that still very much determines who gets hired and who gets promoted based on where researchers publish rather than what they publish, I am afraid we have left the big elephant in the room untouched. I expect from senior and influential colleagues around the world to proactively address this systemic disaster. Solutions are there. For example, universities could develop a non-profit publication consortium and make the private exploitative publishing companies redundant. Please let's expand our surveys about pre-registration and replication beyond the individual researcher and include questions and spaces to reflect what I fear is an even bigger problem. My best wishes.	mixed	improves credibility; does not address real issue		with the current publication system prereg is still not a solution to everything	- preregistration is good - real problem (incentive structures) must change - we need non-profit publishing
R_1BQw5o7fpp09iQk	There seem to be certain costs and benefits associated with preregistration. It is speculative, but I think preregistration limits creativity and the iterative nature of science. To suggest that we know everything prior to data collection and analysis seems problematic to me, and even a little egotistical. It also seems to anchor researchers too strongly to the ideas of the past, without providing enough room for divergent ideas to come into the fold. In contrast, preregistration can help to hold researchers accountable and to attenuate dishonest research practices. It also encourages replication, which is a growing problem in psychology. I see it as a "mixed bag" with some good and some problematic things.	mixed	improves credibility; discourages exploration/creativity		limits creativity, but it increases credibility	- preregistration prevents exploratory work  - preregistration improves credibility - preregistration prevents QRPs

R_cVp0suYCc6YaqdP	Pre-registration has helped me a lot to clear my ideas and go straightforward toward my reserch goals. However, is expensive in terms of preparation, and some times, is kind of discouraging when pursuing some research lines. On the other hand, pre-registering is also expensive, since stating the hypothesis in advance most of the time relies on weak studies, such that we are building hypothesis on the basis of non-replicable studies. Another thing, is that some discourses clearly prioritize pre-registered studies over the others, which increase the inequalities in research. For instance, the gold stantdard is assigned to confirmatory and pre-registered studies, which leave behind other kind of exploratory and descriptive studies. Most of the top journals are really encouraging pre-registering, but at the same time, they are spreading the idea that such studies are better, more impacful, and with more public interest, than other studies. I think that the Open science movement should try to reconcile this debate in academia, in order contribute to reduce (rather than increase) such inequalities in the production of scientific knowledge. Thanks for sending the survey. good luck with your research.	mixed	improves overall quality; inequality		bias towards non-preregistered studies, prereg is based on weak past research	- Preregistration is good - preregistration is more time-consuming - preregsitration discourages exploratory studies - stigma on studies that are not preregistered

R_w5Uu4BJQO0ruFax	I think preregistered studies might make sense for studies that rely on many assumptions to related a pattern of results to a theoretical question. I prefer putting less assumptions and more data that allows for a more complete measurement that truly challenges hypothesis, rather than using a few measurements and hoping that a few bars in chart will look as predicted.	negative	does not address real issue		good for simply hypothesis	- preregistration not relevant in all designs
R_Z7yUaiR4coMl6cp	I think preregistration is great in theory, but in practice it serves only to increase the red tape and time until publication.

R_33jbAKMLBcVgPvt	Profession researchers should be trusted, even if the trust is sometimes misplaced.

R_2rMxShXXtbdFJKc	I appreciate the rationale of preregistration, but in practice it is cumbersome, annoying, and detrimental to the research process.
