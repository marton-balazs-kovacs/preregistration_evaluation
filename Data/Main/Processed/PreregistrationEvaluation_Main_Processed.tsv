R_3plnOMmgE7iMu7b	107	Usually	Strongly Agree	Hypothesis testing	NA	social psychology	prereg	In my experience, pre-registered studies are more work up-front: work that during my training I would have done during data analysis and writing. Some of this work affects the ideal study design, so it's better for that reason that it's earlier in the process. Additionally, I'm convinced it leads to better inference because of the interpretability of p-values. Finally, I feel it lends credibility to the eventual results and manuscripts. So: workflow is front-ended, but not overall more. Data management: because I expect others to see it, I use more reproducible methods and better code, and that probably helps me more than anyone. In terms of quality of research, I find it is higher, in general.	NA	6	"7

When I look at data, my mind goes right to ""Was the preregistration right?"" If not, it stings and I feel like the idea is done for.

My field (animal research) is substantially behind the curve.  To date, of the preregistered studies I have attempted to publish, no reviewer has commented on the preregistration as a positive aspect of the study (the link is always included in the abstract and the methods).  Rather, the reviewers who have mentioned it have used the preregistration to point out deviations (which we take care to explicitly point out in the methods) and thus has led to more challenges with publication rather than fewer.  I am of the opinion that if I had submitted identical studies without preregistration, they would have been easier to publish.  I am hopeful that reviewers will realize the importance of preregistration and use it as an incentive rather than a punishment in the future.  Continued focus on the usefulness and importance of preregistration will hopefully move the field in the right direction.	NA	"7

R_qDsLgbLul4GHRHr	1788	Always	Very Strongly Agree	Hypothesis testing	NA	judgment and decision-making	prereg	Our lab is co-directed by two PIs, one who is a senior researcher who has adopted preregistration and the other (me) who is early mid-career but relatively new to, and not formally trained in, empirical work (long story)so is learning open science practices simultaneously with learning to do empirical work, which makes for an interesting lab. Of course the RA and postdocs are somewhere in between--prior to joining our lab, they had never preregistered but are formally trained in, and have prior experience with, empirical research (though of course not nearly as much as the senior PI). The modest time and stress increase has been due to complex questions about whether/how to preregister exploratory (as opposed to hypothesis-confirming) studies and also what it means to preregister a hypothesis—does it mean that you are simply testing a hypothesis, and if you find a null effect that's fine, or does it mean you are somehow betting on a certain answer, and if you find a different answer that is bad for the publishability of your research. The two questions tend to intersect, inasmuch as those in the lab (e.g., senior PI) who view hypothesis testing as making a bet are probably more likely to deem studies exploratory until they feel confident in that bet, whereas those in the lab (e.g., me) who feel preregistering a hypothesis doesn't necessarily mean you believe the hypothesis will bear itself out, just that you want to know the answer to this specific question, as more like to deem studies hypothesis-confirming earlier. As the baby scientist, I am probably wrong and confused. Anyway, we typically preregister even exploratory research at this point.	NA	5	"4

My only suggestion -- if it even matters for your research question -- is to distinguish between ""preregistered studies that are not published but I intend to publish"" and ""preregistered studies that are not published and I do not intend to publish."" The very first question asking about the types of preregistration/registered reports we had only asked about having ""preregistered studies that I have not published"" and that captures both those who intend to publish it (e.g., I preregistered it and in the midst of data collection/analysis/writing) and those who do not (i.e., those who would be willing to admit to file-drawering).

However, what really Needs to Change is the attitude of Researchers and the community. If everyone is focused on Publishing as much as possible, because Publishing as much as possible is the precondition for an academic Career, introducing preregistrations is not enough. It is so easy to Register different plans for the same study and to remain silent About that. Of Course this is not the Right Thing to do, but the same People who used questionable Research practices before, will easily find ways to transform preregistrations into a questionable (or at least worthless) Research practice. In case this happened, however, a collective expectation that one preregisters one's studies would only be a bureaucratic burden for ""honest"" Researchers and not a way of stopping questionable Research practices."

However, it can save a lot of time once you write the paper because you already have a good amount of work ready in your preregistration.  The only thing that refrain me to preregister all my studies, is that I am an associate professor in a country in which English is not the first language of my students. So not all of them are able to write a pre-registration for their study. I am considering still ask them to write a pre-registration in their first language, but I am worried that reviewers may not accept it as a real pre-registration.	NA	"7

For a couple of years I pre-register all the studies, where I am the PI. At the same time, I have concerns regarding too much of ideology and judgmental evaluations related to pre-registrations and open science. It seems to me that at times it is too much of ""if you don't do it, then you are a bad scientist/person"". Once I have been asked by a reviewer to explain why I haven't pre-registered studies (they were conducted a few years ago) and was suggested that it seems like malpractice. I know that the idea is that we should not have to trust one another (and ourselves), hence pre-registration is a transparent tool. I agree and at the same time lack of pre-registration should not be punished. I believe it is better to reward for good practice, rather than do witch-hunting. I also do not know why at aspredicted.org there was (or is) a new thing that an automatic message pops in when there are two similar pre-registrations and asks you to explain yourself (among others: to state that there is no data point shared between the two pre-registrations). I also do not know how come aspredicted.org was doing the analysis of the pre-registrations and what happens with the answer that one provides. I thought that the page just stores information and the researcher is the only one that decides on this data. I understand that there is a risk that people will pre-register two, contradictory hypothesis and this is why such a message appears in case of similar pre-registrations. Up to which point the idea of pre-registration and open science is to go chasing scientists and suspect the worse? I mean, if somebody wants to behave dishonestly, they will (they can pre-register at two different sites). So, again, I think it is better to work and motivate with rewards, rather than with fear and punishment.  Taken together, I am still in favor of pre-registration and open science and I plan to pre-register the studies that I lead. At the same time, I wish that the movement was more moderate and based more on positive reinforcement."	NA	6	"4

I believe that preregistering the theoretical background, hypothesis, data analysis methods, outliers management, power estimation (a priori) are very important and improve the quality of scientific research.

R_6gRi3xYoRMVrUQ1	478	Rarely	Very Strongly Disagree	Hypothesis testing	NA	Social Psychology	prereg	Preregistration is like the IRB; a well-intended attempt to solve a real problem (research SHOULD be ethical! research SHOULD be rigorous!) that in the end only adds more pointless bureaucracy without actually achieving its intended purpose. Does anyone actually think the IRB actually makes social science research more ethical? Or does it just add increasing administrative paperwork and bureaucratic hoops (at best) and active attempts by IRB’s to overreach and suppress research (at worst)? Preregistration is the same. The intention is good. In practice it’s a lot of time, and bureaucratic paperwork, with little obvious payoff - see for instance recent papers showing almost all papers deviate from the preregistration, often without disclosing. It’s ironic that psychologists came up with such an inefficient bureaucratic poorly thought out administrative solution to what’s really a scientific problem. And I say this as someone who has extensive experience with preregistration and open science - I’ll try any proposed reforms, I have an open mind. This one just isn’t good or feasible or helpful.

It was thought up in a state of paranoia and utter distrust of one's colleagues by people who actually dont understand how real research is actually done, and largely do trivial research. It is based on the incredibly naive view that psychology and the behavioural sciences have strong theory where real predictions can actually be made. They simply dont. Predictions act merely as scapels to help thinking through data in the search for explanations. The most important heuristic feature of research is when your prediction fails because that tells you when you havent really understood how the world works [cf Popper]. At that point, you need to burrow into your data like a terrier to try to figure out what was happening. Preregistration discourages that. It is a sticking plaster for a non-problem and is more likely to impede the growth rather than promote it. It is a pure Emperor's New Clothes phenomenon that has created an illusion of ""science""."

So RCT-style studies should definitely incorporate preregistration as they have done in medical sciences. But I haven't yet seen the value of pre-registration for secondary data analysis or more generally for studies in which you have to examine the structure of the data and variables before you know whether it is feasible to fit more complex statistical models besides ANOVA. Sure, you can include the preliminary analysis in the pre-registration but what's the added value of such pre-registration? And how possible is it to, for instance, to submit the analysis code for such a project already in the pre-registration phase -- this would require skills of clairvoyance from the researchers. Or the researchers would have to carry our research with blinders on, leaving some important aspects of the data unchecked. Also, I am not eager to add pre-registration to the administrative burden that already includes writing research proposals, navigating manuscript submission portals, correctly formatting manuscripts, seeking IRB approval, submitting pre-prints etc. Pre-registration should be developed so that it considers all kinds of relevant psychological research. Otherwise it ends up glorifying some study designs at the expense of others that do not fit the experimental study protocols that are driving the pre-registration idea.	NA	5	"4

Most of my work is quasi-experimental (although some is basic experimental and some is qualitative) so we just don't often have the control we would need to follow through with recommendations made at pre-reg. Also, more than half my work is with industry, which means that sometimes research questions have to be modified partway through because availability/accessibility changes, etc.  Finally, the speed at which our institutions expect us to pump through graduate students often means that pre-reg cannot happen for their work (and most of my work is student-led). In sum, I would very much like to pre-register some studies but circumstances haven't lent themselves to it for me. I don't think that not pre-registering should be frowned upon, nor does it mean that the quality of the work will be less. At the same time, I support the pre-reg movement and I am happy that it is an option.	NA	6	"4

My strategy so far has been to conceptually replicate findings from such ecologically large-scale studies in another similar study, and with preregistered experimental studies (which has been received well by journal editors and reviewers). To me, preregistration itself is not the holy grail (I think that replication more generally might be most important), but it's an extremely useful tool to guide the research process and practices.

Preregistration is meaningful in pharmaceutical experiments, where a national/international agency has full control over the research project, because it can guarantee that the project is not conducted without its permission. In the case of basic research preregistration can be repeated several times via different applications or it can be pretended that the subject of subsequent preregistered studies (coming from the same lab) are different when only the same experiment is ""polished"". E.g. one can ""preregister"" a study _again_ after she/he increased the sample size changed the data analysis etc, pretending that it is a new study. Or one can ""preregesiter"" a study after she/he finished it.  On the other hand, preregistration of studies threaten researcher autonomy, since it is methodologically and statistically sound and valid to run _exploratory_ studies, or to run a second experiment based on the results of a previous one to check the validity of the effect of the latter. Therefore, preregistration can induce the false belief in readers that a study is well conducted, however there is extremely easy to cheat in this process, while it disables or slows true exploratory research down, while decreasing researcher creativity. Moreover, it does not solve the basic issues, which are the consequence of the lack of basic methodological knowledge. In a nutshell: preregistration is a wrong answer and even worse practice to a good question."	NA	"1

R_QbnBhTDDADKHmgh	945	Usually	Agree	Hypothesis testing	NA	Social Psychology	prereg	I fully subscribe to improving science's standards and transparency. Hence, why I engage in pre-registration usually. Of course it is important to improve the behaviour of the individual scientist. However, unless we rid science from the publication for-profit industry and educate our universities not to use the incentive structure that still very much determines who gets hired and who gets promoted based on where researchers publish rather than what they publish, I am afraid we have left the big elephant in the room untouched. I expect from senior and influential colleagues around the world to proactively address this systemic disaster. Solutions are there. For example, universities could develop a non-profit publication consortium and make the private exploitative publishing companies redundant. Please let's expand our surveys about pre-registration and replication beyond the individual researcher and include questions and spaces to reflect what I fear is an even bigger problem. My best wishes.	1	"7

R_1BQw5o7fpp09iQk	1126	Occasionally	Neither Agree or Disagree	Hypothesis testing	NA	evolutionary psychology	control	"There seem to be certain costs and benefits associated with preregistration. It is speculative, but I think preregistration limits creativity and the iterative nature of science. To suggest that we know everything prior to data collection and analysis seems problematic to me, and even a little egotistical. It also seems to anchor researchers too strongly to the ideas of the past, without providing enough room for divergent ideas to come into the fold. In contrast, preregistration can help to hold researchers accountable and to attenuate dishonest research practices. It also encourages replication, which is a growing problem in psychology. I see it as a ""mixed bag"" with some good and some problematic things."	NA	2	6	6	"4

R_cVp0suYCc6YaqdP	1753	Usually	Strongly Agree	Hypothesis testing	NA	social psychology	prereg	Pre-registration has helped me a lot to clear my ideas and go straightforward toward my reserch goals. However, is expensive in terms of preparation, and some times, is kind of discouraging when pursuing some research lines. On the other hand, pre-registering is also expensive, since stating the hypothesis in advance most of the time relies on weak studies, such that we are building hypothesis on the basis of non-replicable studies. Another thing, is that some discourses clearly prioritize pre-registered studies over the others, which increase the inequalities in research. For instance, the gold stantdard is assigned to confirmatory and pre-registered studies, which leave behind other kind of exploratory and descriptive studies. Most of the top journals are really encouraging pre-registering, but at the same time, they are spreading the idea that such studies are better, more impacful, and with more public interest, than other studies. I think that the Open science movement should try to reconcile this debate in academia, in order contribute to reduce (rather than increase) such inequalities in the production of scientific knowledge. Thanks for sending the survey. good luck with your research.	NA	"7
