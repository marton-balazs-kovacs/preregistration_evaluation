1	In 2014, I started to preregister all of my confirmatory studies and develop these studies with the intention to share the data. Preregistration and data sharing have improved my research. My workflow is more transparent (though there is much scope for improvement), and I manage my data better (e.g., labelling variables, documenting data processing decisions).

2	The research process is far clearer for preregistered studies: we agree ahead of time on analysis and sampling plan. I feel that I am making a bet and appropriately indicating my level of certainty. The resulting research feels better organized and far clearer.

3	I generally do preregistrations for all of my studies these days, so the only way for me to respond to this would be to compare it to collaborations led by others (which are not always preregistered) and what I used to do before I started preregistering. The biggest difference is that more of the burden of writing up the design and analyses/analysis plan is put on the front end. This also means that I generally spend considerably more time carefully thinking through my design, how it corresponds to my hypotheses, and precisely how I will test my hypotheses/what would constitute confirmation before launching the study. I feel that all of this has dramatically improved the quality of my work, which is why I have transitioned to preregistering virtually all of my studies at this point.

4	Having pre-registered nearly every study I’ve run in my graduate career, I can say that pre-registration has personally helped me organize my projects and have an easy repository to find old data and materials (I am not always the most organized with my personal computer workflow). Ultimately, pre-registration has not only made my research more consistent and better planned, but also assisted with manuscript writing since a good bulk of the methods section(s) is essentially complete before starting. One downside for me is that sometimes pre-registration can promote a feeling of obligation to continue with projects that are not going to be fruitful or that I’ve simply lost passion for, merely because I’ve publicly “promised” via pre-registration that I would complete something and have results to show for it.

5	the main differences between pre-registered endnote pre-registered studies was for me: thinking more carefully about study designs due to the prompts of the pre-registration forms (e.g. I never thought about the power of a simple CFA before pre-registering a study with a CFA); avoiding unintended HARKing in pre-registered studies; becoming more clear about the own methodological strength and weaknesses while pre-registering	the main differences between pre-registered endnote pre-registered studies was for me: thinking more carefully about study designs due to the prompts of the pre-registration forms (e.g. I never thought about the power of a simple CFA before pre-registering a study with a CFA)	avoiding unintended HARKing in pre-registered studies	becoming more clear about the own methodological strength and weaknesses while pre-registering							
6	Workflow: much more thought goes into planning of study, which makes workflow more logical. Data management: v timeconsuming to get it right - and leads to a lot more data-checking. So slower but more accurate, and well-documented dataset at the end Quality of research: much better because of improvements to workflow and data management - esp advance planning of analysis 	Workflow: much more thought goes into planning of study, which makes workflow more logical.

7	I love preregistering. I haven't tried publishing a 'preregistered report' because I think this would disrupt my flow of data collection, but I do ensure that my publications reflect the preregistration and account for any deviations. As a vision scientist, the pre-registration more aware of the need to properly pilot the experiment before running real participants (for example, finding the best stimulus intensities and number of trials). I make sure to set out my main hypotheses and the appropriate comparisons, if I get lost in data exploration I return to the preregistration to remind myself what the aims were originally. I also feel more confident rejecting participants from further analysis because I preregister criteria for rejection (for example, for chance level performance). When it comes to writing up, I take the preregistered methods and change future tense to past, and that way I don't waste time because I forgot some detail such as monitor resolution.

8	I have now done a couple of preregistered studies, and I did not experience much differences with the non-preregistered ones. It probably helped me to think more critically about the analysis beforehand, having to write it down explicitly, but the other steps were not much different in my experience. One disadvantage that I experienced was during the review process, where I got a comment about the preregistration, which I would otherwise not have received.

9	To me pre-registration is a bit like chess: you have to think about a lot of potential “moves” in advance (different aspects of the design, how participants might react, what to do if you have a lot of missing values, violations of assumptions, etc…). A lot of scenarios might never come to fruition just as your opponent in chess picks one particular line, and in that sense you may have wasted time thinking about all these alternatives. On the other hand, by carefully considering all these scenarios, you are ready for (almost) everything, and are less likely to make a fatal mistake (both in chess and in terms of panning and conducting a study). Also, the more experience you get, the better you become in anticipating different moves. So, my workflow is different: with pre-reg (almost) every design choice, and analysis pipeline is specified before the data collection (except for pilot data), whereas my non pre-reg work is more loosely specified. Note that pre-reg versus non-pre-reg correlates with my maturation as a researcher. So even though the data-management of my pre-reg work is better on average, I can’t say it’s because of pre-reg. If I would have to guess, it’s more about focusing on transparency in general that led me to improve my data-management and pre-reg confirmatory work. Disclaimer: I also teach about pre-reg, so I’m probably biased; also, you might get some socially desirable responses seeing that you are pre-reg advocates yourselves (if I’m not mistaken). Anyway, good luck with the project. Let me know if you need any additional information.

10	workflow: For pre-registered studies, I make sure I the analysis script is ready -- or almost ready -- before starting data collection. This is easy when I have done similar studies before (e.g., with the same paradigm), but when I haven't, I usually simulate some data to test the analysis script. For exploratory (not pre-registered studies) I don't do all this. data management: I can't think of any big differences (e.g., in both cases, I try to share code and data on osf -- so, I would need to go through the same steps). quality of research: Since doing pre-registered studies, I feel much more confident in the conclusions that I draw from my confirmatory research.	workflow: For pre-registered studies, I make sure I the analysis script is ready -- or almost ready -- before starting data collection.

11	In my experience, pre-registered studies are more work up-front: work that during my training I would have done during data analysis and writing. Some of this work affects the ideal study design, so it's better for that reason that it's earlier in the process. Additionally, I'm convinced it leads to better inference because of the interpretability of p-values. Finally, I feel it lends credibility to the eventual results and manuscripts. So: workflow is front-ended, but not overall more. Data management: because I expect others to see it, I use more reproducible methods and better code, and that probably helps me more than anyone. In terms of quality of research, I find it is higher, in general. 	pre-registered studies are more work up-front: work that during my training I would have done during data analysis and writing.

12	I don’t find any noticeable difference in the amount of work required for a preregistered vs. a non-preregistered project, rather it’s mainly just a matter of doing things in a different order. Specifically one needs to write the methods/procedure text before instead of after data collection. I can’t really think of any differences in terms of data management. In terms of quality, obviously it makes a big difference, for example by forcing one to test a larger sample than might otherwise be the case, and tying one’s hands in terms of data mining.

13	Here are my experiences with respect to your questions: - Workflow: Preregistrations (should) have a higher standard of writing than personal project notes of non-preregistered projects. The necessity to write a preregistration before data collection begins slows these projects down. At least in my experience, the preregistration documents cannot be recycled for the paper. Otherwise, the workflow is independent of the presence of a preregistration. - Data management: I am a proponent of open science and make as much material from my projects available as possible, in the most useful format possible. Therefore, there are no differences between preregistered and non-preregistered studies. - Quality of research: I do not see a difference in the quality of research between preregistered and not-preregistered projects and I do not decide whether to preregister or not based on the quality of the research question.	The necessity to write a preregistration before data collection begins slows these projects down.									
14	I have now completed several studies that I have preregistered and have completed a few Registered Reports. The major difference between this research and non-preregistered research is that I am forced to spend a lot more time planning and thinking about my preregistered studies. This planning and thinking process has been extremely beneficial to my research and I often find it makes the writing process easier after I have the data. Despite what many people think, I have not found that preregistration takes much time, not do I think it has stifled my creativity. I don't know if preregistration has improved my data management directly.

15	In my experience, our research became more rigorous for preregistered projects because the registration made us specify and write down the hypotheses, in/exclusion criteria, and analysis pipelines in much more detail than we would have usually done. Spending more time planing the experiments before conducting them also helped streamline the workflow and thus facilitated collecting and analyzing the data in a team.

16	Pre-registration generally streamlines the workflow and makes things go faster; this is because there are many fewer exploratory analyses to consider, so there is objectively less data analysis to conduct. The data management is about the same for me, as I am relatively meticulous about data management regardless of whether or not I preregister. The quality of the research is mixed; on one hand, preregistration makes the preregistered analysis more trustworthy for reasons I'm sure you're well aware of. However, the peer review process suggested an alternative analysis strategy which was, frankly, better than what I had originally preregistered. I reported it as an exploratory analysis, but it did suggest to me that preregistering a subpar analysis might not lead to high quality research. Presumably registered reports would partially mitigate this issue. So preregistration was a net positive for quality, but has potential pitfalls if it is rushed.

17	I have pre-registered three projects, of which two are registered reports. I thought that I got better each time at dealing with the process - and I definitely prefer registered reports to pre-registration, as it allows us to improve design based on reviewer feedback. Workflow: I think workflow is improved by pre-registration, both for students and for me! It forces us to set clear and addressable hypotheses. It also forces to confront issues of power early on. Data management: I don’t think that pre-registration changes how I manage data, although the need to make data open access does lead to better data curation. Quality of research: Pre-registration doesn’t allow you to delude yourself about the pattern of results that you get. This is more of a danger than we believe it is. For my BMC Psychology paper, I remember thinking my results were entirely in line with what I expected, only to go back to my pre-registration and see they were not the hypotheses I specified.

18	Here is my perspective: I strongly support pre-registration and the adoption of other methodological innovations (new and not so new) that help increase the confidence in research and our fields of science. Pre-registration forces me to develop more materials up front, writing the hypotheses, methods, and analyses sections as they would appear in an eventual manuscript. This takes considerable time, I am very busy and work on a wide variety of projects, so I usually have to write new material. I do not have the time to pre-register everything, so I tend to pre-register projects that I am excited about and believe are theoretically innovative. I tend not to pre-register exploratory studies or ones where the results are not surprising and add incrementally to an established literature. The benefits of pre-registration to my own work quality is that I have to clearly specify the hypotheses and make clear connections among the hypotheses, methods, and analyses before data collection. Sometimes I have an idea and add a new measure at the beginning of data collection, after I have pre-registered the project. I describe this appropriately in the manuscript and have not had any problematic issues with reviewers on this.

19	Our pre-defined (and properly powered) recruitment targets have made the workflow far easier to manage than our non-preregistered studies - these fundamental aspects of experimental design are no longer simply guess-work. Data analysis scripts are now coded up before we get the final datasets, and analysis is performed within an afternoon rather than spending months searching for significant findings. The quality of my research has undoubtedly improved with the introduction of preregistration, specifically that I am now confident of the results that I publish, and I am a much happier scientist because of this!

20	Workflow: It seems like preregistration has helped me to "front-load" project work, such that I spend more time thinking about how the hypothesis to be tested relates to the study design and analysis plan before the data are collected. In my experience, this has caused an increase in the quality of my work. Specifically, tightening the link between data - informative study design - informative analysis plan. However, I also completed my PhD and have learned a lot in academia at the same time as I've learned to use preregistration, so it's hard to evaluate the counterfactual (i.e., would my work be slightly less improved now if I'd never used preregistration - hard to tell). Data management: To be honest, the type of preregistration I've used (hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans) has not really affected the way I approach data management. That is, even in projects where preregistration hasn't been used, my data curating and sharing practices have been much the same. Quality of research: I guess I already addressed how preregistration has improved the quality of my work in the heading "workflow". I would like to report a negative experience about my use of preregistration (where it made the quality of my work actively worse), but honestly I can't think of any. The only downside to preregistration that I've experienced is cases where I've preregistered a suboptimal analysis plan (and this coming to light after data collection), resulting in me noting this sub-optimality in the writing up of the project for publication. This downside is purely to my self-interest though, as it probably exposes that I didn't think hard enough prior to data collection. I find it hard to believe I would've thought any harder in the absence of preregistration, so I don't judge this as negatively affecting the quality of my work. In fact, since it forces transparency, it's probably a bonus to the work overall!

21	Due to the written (rather than just verbal) discussions and the opportunity to get their name on a preregistration, PIs and collaborators get more involved in the beginning of the conduction of the study. This ensures that the study is thoroughly discussed with an expert before it is conducted. Regarding the workflow: we now have a table of hypotheses and related planned analyses before testing. After testing we then conduct exactly those analyses and add a field with results to this very same table. This way we can ensure that we conduct every analysis we planned and that, if we decide to conduct additional tests, these are clearly marked as exploratory. I believe that the quality has improved in the sense that researcher degree of freedom are minimized. There may be quality problems if the preregistration did not initially choose the best analysis method (these can be solved with better preregistrations – we got better over time ;) – or by conducting additional exploratory analyses).

22	Workflow: Pro: Pre-registration forces you to be precise in your thinking and measurement and creates commitment for the researcher. Con: Working with pre-registration typically takes much longer for two reasons: 1) there’s additional administrative stuff that needs to be done (e.g., filling in forms etc.) which takes a lot of time and reduces productivity compared to people who don’t do it, 2) it is more costly to do research because studies have to be run multiple times. Data management: There’s not much difference in my experience. I aim to upload data and materials to OSF anyway. Quality of research: Pro: Pre-reg reduces the likelihood of using false positives in your research because it forces you to use fewer measures. Con: Pre-reg (the way it’s currently propagated) is not very practical for complex samples (e.g., ESM studies, multi-wave studies, costly professional samples) where the hypothesis is not always clear in advance and you only have one opportunity to collect all the measures you suspect could be affected.

23	I have noted the following differences with regard to my experience with studies that are preregistered vs not preregistered: Compared to studies that were not preregistered, in preregistered studies: -I spent more time thinking about the expected effect size (or smallest effect size of interest) before doing analyses, which is related to the fact that I did more detailed power analyses in preregistered studies. -I shift more of the work to the stage before data-collection/analyses, but save time doing and reporting the analyses. -I Feel more confident about my decisions during the analytic process. Deviating from the original planned analyses feels less wrong, because of the requirement to report the deviations. This transparency reduces my fear of making decisions because of confirmation bias without others being able to evaluate my decisions. -Related, preregistrations, helped me keeping track of which tests were confirmatory and which analyses were exploratory. Without a preregistration, this distinction may be hard to make, especially when work on the paper spans several months or years. It is easy to forget which analyses were planned, and which were carried out after initial data analyses.

24	Since 2017, I have pre-registered every study on which I am lead or senior author. I think pre-registered studies are planned more thoroughly before data are collected. For example, it makes it easier for power analyses to be conducted, because the precise data-analytical approach is decided before data are collected. As we are juggling multiple projects, I find pre-registration improves my management of projects; at any time I can refer to the pre-reg document to remind myself of our approach and hypotheses. I don’t find any difference in the management of the empirical data collected. In terms of quality, I think when our a priori predictions are supported, the findings are more compelling (than if we had not pre-registered). This is because it signals to others that these were indeed the effects that we predicted at the outset. From observing the work of others, however, I think it is important that the pre-registration is considered and contains enough information such that people can assess if the pre-reg was followed. Basically, I think that the quality of the pre-reg is very important, and sometimes this can take a long time. Saying that, once the details of the pre-reg are considered, this can speed up the writing and analysis when the data are collected (the hard work determining analytical approach has already been completed).

25	Pre-registration has smoothed my workflow by forcing me to plan my research to a much finer degree than before. Regarding data analysis, the planning stage has also facilitated a habit of data simulation, so I can pre-register my R code. This is incredibly valuable. Regarding data management, it has made no obvious impact. I believe the quality of my research has been greatly enhanced. I find holding myself accountable very valuable. I also find it incredibly useful to protect my work against post-hoc reviewers (#notallreviewers, of course), but there's always some who tell me (and my colleagues) that the hypotheses don't match the data. A pre-reg document is useful in that situation. (However, I am happy to yield to superior analyses if suggested by a reviewer, with full declaration, of course). I've also found it useful to have my junior colleagues in ... less ideal labs ... to pre-register their projects, to avoid old-school researchers asking them to be selective in their reporting, or to make claims (wilfully, or forgetfully) about certain hypotheses or planned analyses.

26	I enjoyed pre-registering my last study. Pre-registering the project shaped the research process. It took a little more work upfront. While it is typical to lay out hypotheses before conducting any experiment, it was more clear cut and spelled out with pre-registration. Data management was similar--it's an extra step to upload the data to OSF but that's about it. Overall, I think pre-registering a study purifies the research process. The research is laid out and there's less room for subjectivity and bias.	Pre-registering the project shaped the research process. It took a little more work upfront.

27	starting preregistrations (about 4 years ago) has been truly a life-changing moment for me as a scientist. Preregistration motivates me to think more about my research before I do it, which means that I usually come up with higher-quality materials and designs before I run my experiments. I spend more time now preparing the research and much less time analyzing the data and publishing studies. This is a more meaningful use of my time. I also feel more certain regarding the results of my studies and I am no longer stressed about whether my results are positive or not. To sum up, preregistration helped me to re-focus my attention on things that I can change and where I can be truly creative (preparation stage) and helped me to avoid the stress when facing the results of my research and the publication process. Also, my workflow seems to be more straightforward now: idea -> preregistration -> results ->very quick analysis -> publish/ resubmit but certainly not revise the paper from scratch	Preregistration motivates me to think more about my research before I do it, which means that I usually come up with higher-quality materials and designs before I run my experiments.

28	I try to preregister confirmatory studies that will end up in a paper. As a result, my preregistered vs. non-preregistered studies differ quite a bit because they are achieving different goals. My non-preregistered studies are typically exploratory in order to get a sense of whether a research question is interesting and how to go about testing it, while my preregistered studies are about ensuring that the effect is real. As a result, the workflow for the preregistered studies is generally simpler and clearer, and the data management is more careful (e.g., the R code is cleaner). The quality of the study design I don't think differs, but I do have more confidence that any results I find are more likely to be true.

29	At the beginning I always think about preregistration as an additional burden while planning a study. But I usually quickly recognize that my preregistered studies are much better conceived from the beginning on. Another advantage clearly is that you are not even slightly tempted to run additional analyses and frame them as confirmatory.

30	I think preregistration is tremendously helpful as it forces you to think everything through, preventing from making data-driven decisions. When you lack experience with a specific design, pilots may be required to make a good preregistration. Preregistration is sometimes frustrating because you cannot predict everything that can happen and because it slows down the start of data collection. But the latter may actually be an advantage too, as we may end up with fewer but better studies.

31	Normally, I am working with existing large-scale data set which means that there is a long period in which I get to know the data before I settle on the final analyses. In the projects I have pre-registered, this workflow is of course different because I have to spend a more time thinking about the best possible analyses to address my research question prior to seeing the data. While I have always encountered issues in implementing my pre-registered analyses (e.g., learning about problems of the analyses I had planned), which led to various deviations, I got the impression that spending more time reflecting on the proper analysis strategy has improved the quality of my research.

32	Workflow: The preregistration, in particular as a registered report, forced me to plan very well and think about responsibilities of different contributors. Also it forced me to think more clearly about my hypothesis and the predictions that follow from it. Thanks to this very goal-oriented planning, and the fact that you do not have any incentive to keep on playing with your analyses, my pre-registered projects were the most efficient ones I did. Data management: No big difference from normal. Quality: My pre-registered results are my only published results that I fully believe.

33	I have pre-registered several studies over the years, and the process has changed over time. My first pre-registered study (published in 2014) likely looks very different from my most recent (stage 2 RR under review currently). The workflow for pre-registered projects is more front-loaded. This means that we do things in the beginning that we used to do at the end. The analysis is very challenging to plan, but actually running the analysis is simpler once the data are in. There is not as much temptation to choose specifications that are favorable to the conclusions; it relieves some pressure on me to make the results conform to a particular outcome. (This is especially true for registered reports, where statistical significance is not relevant.) I'm not sure I've discerned much effect of pre-registration specifically on data management. My data management habits have changed over this same time period to ensure fewer errors and greater reproducibility, but I would characterize this change as independent of the decision to pre-register.

34	I decide to preregister a study after pilot testing, once I have a better idea of what is going to happen, what the data are going to look like and what the appropriate analyses are. The workflow, data management, and quality of research are similar between preregistered and not preregistered studies because we try to hold to an ethical ideal regardless of whether other researchers are going to see it or not. The main difference comes really in planning the analyses beforehand or not.

35	The reviews were very constructive and helpful for designing the studies which improved the quality of the research. Also, although review rounds take time until you can finally collect your data, the process of publishing was quick compared to other projects in which you do not have an in principle acceptance.										
36	Actually, I have preregistered all my studies that I have conducted myself. The main advantage of doing so, it is that it encourages yourself to think over all the aspect related to the methodology and data analysis and many ideas appears during the process and other authors interested in the topic can have access to them.

37	Preregistration helps me clarify my thinking about which statistical procedure(s) represents the best or most appropriate way to test my hypothesis(es). When I haven't forced myself to plan ahead, I find that when it comes time to analyze the data, I start almost immediately in "exploration" mode - doing multiple analyses quite rapidly to understand the pattern of results. It is very easy, absent preregistration, to quickly develop a post hoc rationalization for whichever test or set of tests produce the best data. I still engage in this data exploration when I preregister - the only difference it that preregistration allows me to have more confidence in the validity of my hypothesis testing because I've put some thought into what the central test is prior to looking at the data.

38	regarding workflow and quality of research: Pre-registration is strictly superior to not registering. Pre-registration means being clear about what you are going to do before doing it. A lot of researchers, myself included before I started pre-registering, design a study that seems to make sense, then run it. Then, when it comes time to analyze and think concretely about the analysis, problems crop up, experimenter degrees of freedom enter the picture, and regrets creep in about what wasn't included in the study or about how something was overlooked. There are often facets of experiments and analyses scientists think they understand, and they do in a vague way, but they don't actually consider the concrete details until it's too late. Writing out a a pre-registration helps you find design issues while they can still be fixed. The researcher forces themselves to examine the details of future analyses before committing to a design, thereby improving the design itself. This makes the research more efficient and useful and streamlines the study in the process. Thinking of including a questionnaire? Without pre-reg, I would just include it. With pre-reg, I think about WHY I might to include it, what analyses I might run, what it would look like in a published paper, and what reviewers might think about it. Pre-registration makes research more conscious. Pre-registration makes me think of better study designs. By thinking ahead and considering the analysis and publication, I am emboldened to revise my design to make it better: more efficient, more useful, more understandable, more ambitious. I am more likely to build a clever design where I can get multiple pre-registrations and thus multiple publications from a single study design. When it comes time to run the analysis, it is so easy if you have a pre-registration! It's all right there, decided by your past self. A pre-registration is a gift to your future self. A pre-registration is quintessentially delayed gratification. The hardest part about pre-registration is forcing yourself to work now when you could leave it to later. The pay-off is worth it, though. While I think the field needs to ease up on some fronts (e.g. we should be doing power analyses but we should not be held to the highest standard of doing the most advanced predictive modelling for power analysis; something simple should suffice to indicate we have at least enough power, especially if we collect well above the sample size indicated by a modest power analysis) I think the field should push for more pre-registration. Anything that isn't pre-registered is untrustworthy. It is simply too easy for researchers to selectively report and to fool themselves into thinking their research is robust because a p-value is low. Most researchers don't understand p-values anyway. regarding data-management: I don't think pre-registration is intrinsically tied to open materials and open data, but they often go together. As such, I don't really have anything to say about pre-registration's effects on data-management other than this: by thinking through analysis ahead of time, pre-registration ensures you collect the necessary data. Open materials are so crucial to understanding research. It is all too easy to overlook the contents of a paradigm and be seduced by the name of a questionnaire or task when, if the reader actually read the questionnaire, they might not accept it as a measure of what it claims to measure, likewise for a task. Open data is crucial for honesty and integrity. At first it can be a bit anxiety producing to share one's data, to draw back the curtain, revealing not the pristine publication but the dirty reality of messy processing scripts and ugly data. Unveiling reality is what should be done, though. Open data allows other researchers to question findings and investigate their own questions about data that may no interest the authors. The author need not indulge queries about fine details of the data because the other researcher can simply answer it for themselves when they have access. Most importantly, by uploading data to a repository, like the Open Science Framework, that data is properly archived. Academia, especially early on in one's career, involves moving to different places, changing emails every few years, and using different computers with different hard-drives. Data so easily gets lost or becomes inaccessible. Even if the researcher still has access, it takes so much more effort to find something amid all the possible places it could be rather than point someone to an OSF repository where it will be. It might be reasonable to accept that a researcher doesn't have time to go digging through a backlog of their work to find data from five or ten years ago; it is much less reasonable to claim that the researcher doesn't have time to upload their data to the OSF while they are going through the publication process. Yes, it takes more time, but what may take an hour today saves everyone time later and ensures the data is available. I hope that one day, open materials and open data are standard, mandatory practices that are part of publication. Every paper should come with a link to the data and the materials.

39	I preregister to protect myself from the temptation to phack. It also makes it easy to run results if I have written the code in advance. Without a doubt, my science is more honest when I preregister.  	I preregister to protect myself from the temptation to phack.

40	I take part in many projects led by a member of my lab, which are preregistered because the lead researcher believes that it is a good thing to do. With projects that I take the lead on, I've only ever preregistered one, because I wanted to make the experience. So I took part in the OSF preregistration challenge, doing it exactly by their instructions. It changed the workflow of those experiments because I wrote most of the analysis scripts before looking at the data (and actually ran it on simulated data). It did not change the data management (we publish raw data on OSF on all published experiments whether or not they were preregistered). Apart from changing the order in which I did things, it did not change anything. Hence, I don't think it had any effect on the quality of the research.

41	The changes are that we do more advance planning of the analyses, which sometimes leads to changes in the research design because we have thought things through more carefully as we write them down. The research definitely ends up being higher quality, on average.

42	My experience with pre-registration has been mostly positive. The process of preparing a pre-registration takes some time and imposes a small delay, but, in my experience, this small negative has been well worth it for the benefit of having all collaborators on the same page, a clear conceptualization and plan for data analysis. I also find the process of posting data pushes us to keep better records and data files for transparency. In short, I think the process has pushed me to conduct better science than before.

43	I now preregister all my projects, and the changes I have noticed are that it makes my workflow more efficient. Data analysis is much faster when projects are finished because I already have a plan and am not tempted to "explore." It also improves the workflow because it acts as a "to-do" list of sorts that helps organize what steps the project needs. Data management is also much improved in the prereg era, but I attribute this more to the fact that I am posting/sharing data and code online so have to make it understandable to others. Pre-registration has certainly improved the quality of my research because I am thinking more carefully ahead of time about all the controls/concerns that I might otherwise not think of until after data collection.

44	My experience with preregistration has been relatively positive. Honestly, I do not see much difference between studies that I preregister vs. those that I do not. The only difference is that extra step of red-tape needed before data collection can begin. This can be somewhat annoying, and is often a barrier to preregistration for me. Nevertheless, I support the effort to encourage preregistration. My only concern is that eventually there will just be too many preregistrations for a person to ever look through. I would rather see this technique used strategically (e.g., to confirm initially unexpected findings with an a priori preregistered follow-up) rather than a standard “always preregister everything” practice. I could be persuaded though.	Honestly, I do not see much difference between studies that I preregister vs. those that I do not.

45	Benefits: It is useful to submit a protocol in this manner as it can help clarify your thinking and bring the project together in a nice manner. One negative thing about the process is that in one case of a meta-analysis, I did not pre-register as it was an update of another meta-analysis, but then the reviewers at a journal asked for a registration. Although pre-registration is useful I’m unsure if it is essential in all cases, i.e. when departments or teams are busy anyway updating projects continually, why the necessity for a new protocol if it developed from research already published by that team?

46	Honestly, preregistration has not changed my workflow much. I already specify materials, measures, hypothesis, and analysis plans at the point of IRB submission, so now I just repeat that on OSF. I could probably be better about uploading analysis code earlier in the process, but I usually do the coding and de-identify the data prior to uploading those to OSF at the time of manuscript submission.  Plus, I have no problem reporting changes to preregistered plans based on unanticipated outcomes of the research process (and I report exploratory analysis as such). My undergraduate students (in both research methods/upper-division lab classes and those who work in my lab for credit) have also easily adapted to preregistration. Because I work at an exclusively undergraduate institution, preregistered REPORTS are a no-go for me because the delay between planning and executing would significantly impact the way students engage in the research process.

47	Workflow: As compared to not pre-registering, pre-registered resulted in a more linear or at least organized workflow. It focused us on the core analysis that would be done on the study, made sure these analyses were feasible, given the design and measures, and probably saved us time in terms of cutting down on extra analysis or having to iterate  Data management: As far as data management goes, for the particular projects we were working on (simple between condition lab or survey experiments), pre-registering didn't change much about data management -- aside from, as I mentioned above (perhaps in the wrong section), cutting down on the collection of unnecessary data, making sure we were collecting the right data, and reducing unnecessary or uninformative analyses. Quality of research: I think pre-registering our study definitely resulted in high quality confirmatory research. Our goal for the studies we were pre-registering was to be clear about effect we were specifying and increase our audience's confidence that this is a genuine effect. For these goals, I think pre-registration was effective. (One slight thought I'll mention is I now feel an obligation to pre-register all the studies I conduct. Nothing is really restricted by this, as I can always go beyond the pre-registration and simply make it clear I did so. However, I have wondered if always starting from a place of specifying the main analyses/analyses that will be central from the outset limits/constricts the types of studies I conduct or datasets I explore. It's possible that purposefully doing some highly unplanned, very exploratory analyses can sometimes lead to insights, new ideas, ideas for then more specific analyses that wouldn't have been arrived if always starting from a place of pre-registration. Also perhaps if I were to always pre-register, I would be less likely to try out methods I am less familiar with, because I am less sure of how to specify what I want to do--which I would otherwise kind of learn along the way. I recognize that this is a bit of a false dichotomy. But in practice, it is possible that a shift towards pre-registration does results in some of these changes/re-prioritizations. Just a dumb/half-formed thought.)	Workflow: As compared to not pre-registering, pre-registered resulted in a more linear or at least organized workflow.

48	During the past three years, I have preregistered all my studies. However, based on the aims of a study, the preregistration could differ (we chose a platform to preregister based on how strict guidelines for preregistration are). Overall, I don’t think that I would have conducted the studies differently without preregistration. However, it gives you credibility when you decide to do some non-standard things beforehand. Furthermore, when analyzing data, and results are not really what you expected, I usually make a clear distinction in research reports between what we preregistered and post-hoc, exploratory analyses. This might also be clearer for the reader than without the preregistration. As disadvantages: it takes more time and you need to think about certain things beforehand (but this is not necessarily a bad thing). Overall: no differences in workflow (except a bit more time) and data management, and quality is identical or better when using preregistrations.

49	Preregistration made the workflow of my study easier by providing a centralized documentation that I can rely on to create stimuli and procedure. For non-preregistered research, a lot of time is spent for trial-and-error process to design the experiment. For my preregistered project, I had to go through this process beforehand to create a preregistration document, which worked well for me, and I believe eventually improved the overall methodology and quality of the study.
