25	Pre-registration has smoothed my workflow by forcing me to plan my research to a much finer degree than before. Regarding data analysis, the planning stage has also facilitated a habit of data simulation, so I can pre-register my R code. This is incredibly valuable. Regarding data management, it has made no obvious impact. I believe the quality of my research has been greatly enhanced. I find holding myself accountable very valuable. I also find it incredibly useful to protect my work against post-hoc reviewers (#notallreviewers, of course), but there's always some who tell me (and my colleagues) that the hypotheses don't match the data. A pre-reg document is useful in that situation. (However, I am happy to yield to superior analyses if suggested by a reviewer, with full declaration, of course). I've also found it useful to have my junior colleagues in ... less ideal labs ... to pre-register their projects, to avoid old-school researchers asking them to be selective in their reporting, or to make claims (wilfully, or forgetfully) about certain hypotheses or planned analyses.	03	I believe the quality of my research has been greatly enhanced.

26	I enjoyed pre-registering my last study. Pre-registering the project shaped the research process. It took a little more work upfront. While it is typical to lay out hypotheses before conducting any experiment, it was more clear cut and spelled out with pre-registration. Data management was similar--it's an extra step to upload the data to OSF but that's about it. Overall, I think pre-registering a study purifies the research process. The research is laid out and there's less room for subjectivity and bias.	01	Pre-registering the project shaped the research process. It took a little more work upfront.

27	starting preregistrations (about 4 years ago) has been truly a life-changing moment for me as a scientist. Preregistration motivates me to think more about my research before I do it, which means that I usually come up with higher-quality materials and designs before I run my experiments. I spend more time now preparing the research and much less time analyzing the data and publishing studies. This is a more meaningful use of my time. I also feel more certain regarding the results of my studies and I am no longer stressed about whether my results are positive or not. To sum up, preregistration helped me to re-focus my attention on things that I can change and where I can be truly creative (preparation stage) and helped me to avoid the stress when facing the results of my research and the publication process. Also, my workflow seems to be more straightforward now: idea -> preregistration -> results ->very quick analysis -> publish/ resubmit but certainly not revise the paper from scratch	01	Preregistration motivates me to think more about my research before I do it, which means that I usually come up with higher-quality materials and designs before I run my experiments.

28	I try to preregister confirmatory studies that will end up in a paper. As a result, my preregistered vs. non-preregistered studies differ quite a bit because they are achieving different goals. My non-preregistered studies are typically exploratory in order to get a sense of whether a research question is interesting and how to go about testing it, while my preregistered studies are about ensuring that the effect is real. As a result, the workflow for the preregistered studies is generally simpler and clearer, and the data management is more careful (e.g., the R code is cleaner).

While I have always encountered issues in implementing my pre-registered analyses (e.g., learning about problems of the analyses I had planned), which led to various deviations, I got the impression that spending more time reflecting on the proper analysis strategy has improved the quality of my research.	01	In the projects I have pre-registered, this workflow is of course different because I have to spend a more time thinking about the best possible analyses to address my research question prior to seeing the data.

My first pre-registered study (published in 2014) likely looks very different from my most recent (stage 2 RR under review currently). The workflow for pre-registered projects is more front-loaded. This means that we do things in the beginning that we used to do at the end. The analysis is very challenging to plan, but actually running the analysis is simpler once the data are in. There is not as much temptation to choose specifications that are favorable to the conclusions; it relieves some pressure on me to make the results conform to a particular outcome.

38	regarding workflow and quality of research: Pre-registration is strictly superior to not registering. Pre-registration means being clear about what you are going to do before doing it. A lot of researchers, myself included before I started pre-registering, design a study that seems to make sense, then run it. Then, when it comes time to analyze and think concretely about the analysis, problems crop up, experimenter degrees of freedom enter the picture, and regrets creep in about what wasn't included in the study or about how something was overlooked. There are often facets of experiments and analyses scientists think they understand, and they do in a vague way, but they don't actually consider the concrete details until it's too late. Writing out a a pre-registration helps you find design issues while they can still be fixed. The researcher forces themselves to examine the details of future analyses before committing to a design, thereby improving the design itself. This makes the research more efficient and useful and streamlines the study in the process. Thinking of including a questionnaire? Without pre-reg, I would just include it. With pre-reg, I think about WHY I might to include it, what analyses I might run, what it would look like in a published paper, and what reviewers might think about it. Pre-registration makes research more conscious. Pre-registration makes me think of better study designs. By thinking ahead and considering the analysis and publication, I am emboldened to revise my design to make it better: more efficient, more useful, more understandable, more ambitious. I am more likely to build a clever design where I can get multiple pre-registrations and thus multiple publications from a single study design. When it comes time to run the analysis, it is so easy if you have a pre-registration! It's all right there, decided by your past self. A pre-registration is a gift to your future self. A pre-registration is quintessentially delayed gratification. The hardest part about pre-registration is forcing yourself to work now when you could leave it to later. The pay-off is worth it, though. While I think the field needs to ease up on some fronts (e.g. we should be doing power analyses but we should not be held to the highest standard of doing the most advanced predictive modelling for power analysis; something simple should suffice to indicate we have at least enough power, especially if we collect well above the sample size indicated by a modest power analysis) I think the field should push for more pre-registration. Anything that isn't pre-registered is untrustworthy. It is simply too easy for researchers to selectively report and to fool themselves into thinking their research is robust because a p-value is low. Most researchers don't understand p-values anyway. regarding data-management: I don't think pre-registration is intrinsically tied to open materials and open data, but they often go together. As such, I don't really have anything to say about pre-registration's effects on data-management other than this: by thinking through analysis ahead of time, pre-registration ensures you collect the necessary data. Open materials are so crucial to understanding research. It is all too easy to overlook the contents of a paradigm and be seduced by the name of a questionnaire or task when, if the reader actually read the questionnaire, they might not accept it as a measure of what it claims to measure, likewise for a task. Open data is crucial for honesty and integrity. At first it can be a bit anxiety producing to share one's data, to draw back the curtain, revealing not the pristine publication but the dirty reality of messy processing scripts and ugly data. Unveiling reality is what should be done, though. Open data allows other researchers to question findings and investigate their own questions about data that may no interest the authors. The author need not indulge queries about fine details of the data because the other researcher can simply answer it for themselves when they have access.

It might be reasonable to accept that a researcher doesn't have time to go digging through a backlog of their work to find data from five or ten years ago; it is much less reasonable to claim that the researcher doesn't have time to upload their data to the OSF while they are going through the publication process.

A lot of researchers, myself included before I started pre-registering, design a study that seems to make sense, then run it. Then, when it comes time to analyze and think concretely about the analysis, problems crop up, experimenter degrees of freedom enter the picture, and regrets creep in about what wasn't included in the study or about how something was overlooked. There are often facets of experiments and analyses scientists think they understand, and they do in a vague way, but they don't actually consider the concrete details until it's too late. Writing out a a pre-registration helps you find design issues while they can still be fixed. The researcher forces themselves to examine the details of future analyses before committing to a design, thereby improving the design itself. This makes the research more efficient and useful and streamlines the study in the process. Thinking of including a questionnaire? Without pre-reg, I would just include it. With pre-reg, I think about WHY I might to include it, what analyses I might run, what it would look like in a published paper, and what reviewers might think about it. Pre-registration makes research more conscious. Pre-registration makes me think of better study designs. By thinking ahead and considering the analysis and publication, I am emboldened to revise my design to make it better: more efficient, more useful, more understandable, more ambitious. I am more likely to build a clever design where I can get multiple pre-registrations and thus multiple publications from a single study design. When it comes time to run the analysis, it is so easy if you have a pre-registration! It's all right there, decided by your past self. A pre-registration is a gift to your future self. A pre-registration is quintessentially delayed gratification. The hardest part about pre-registration is forcing yourself to work now when you could leave it to later. The pay-off is worth it, though. While I think the field needs to ease up on some fronts (e.g. we should be doing power analyses but we should not be held to the highest standard of doing the most advanced predictive modelling for power analysis; something simple should suffice to indicate we have at least enough power, especially if we collect well above the sample size indicated by a modest power analysis) I think the field should push for more pre-registration. Anything that isn't pre-registered is untrustworthy. It is simply too easy for researchers to selectively report and to fool themselves into thinking their research is robust because a p-value is low. Most researchers don't understand p-values anyway. regarding data-management: I don't think pre-registration is intrinsically tied to open materials and open data, but they often go together. As such, I don't really have anything to say about pre-registration's effects on data-management other than this: by thinking through analysis ahead of time, pre-registration ensures you collect the necessary data. Open materials are so crucial to understanding research. It is all too easy to overlook the contents of a paradigm and be seduced by the name of a questionnaire or task when, if the reader actually read the questionnaire, they might not accept it as a measure of what it claims to measure, likewise for a task. Open data is crucial for honesty and integrity. At first it can be a bit anxiety producing to share one's data, to draw back the curtain, revealing not the pristine publication but the dirty reality of messy processing scripts and ugly data. Unveiling reality is what should be done, though. Open data allows other researchers to question findings and investigate their own questions about data that may no interest the authors.

At first it can be a bit anxiety producing to share one's data, to draw back the curtain, revealing not the pristine publication but the dirty reality of messy processing scripts and ugly data. Unveiling reality is what should be done, though. Open data allows other researchers to question findings and investigate their own questions about data that may no interest the authors. The author need not indulge queries about fine details of the data because the other researcher can simply answer it for themselves when they have access. Most importantly, by uploading data to a repository, like the Open Science Framework, that data is properly archived. Academia, especially early on in one's career, involves moving to different places, changing emails every few years, and using different computers with different hard-drives. Data so easily gets lost or becomes inaccessible. Even if the researcher still has access, it takes so much more effort to find something amid all the possible places it could be rather than point someone to an OSF repository where it will be. It might be reasonable to accept that a researcher doesn't have time to go digging through a backlog of their work to find data from five or ten years ago; it is much less reasonable to claim that the researcher doesn't have time to upload their data to the OSF while they are going through the publication process. Yes, it takes more time, but what may take an hour today saves everyone time later and ensures the data is available. I hope that one day, open materials and open data are standard, mandatory practices that are part of publication. Every paper should come with a link to the data and the materials.	08	While I think the field needs to ease up on some fronts (e.g. we should be doing power analyses but we should not be held to the highest standard of doing the most advanced predictive modelling for power analysis; something simple should suffice to indicate we have at least enough power, especially if we collect well above the sample size indicated by a modest power analysis)	NA
38	regarding workflow and quality of research: Pre-registration is strictly superior to not registering. Pre-registration means being clear about what you are going to do before doing it. A lot of researchers, myself included before I started pre-registering, design a study that seems to make sense, then run it. Then, when it comes time to analyze and think concretely about the analysis, problems crop up, experimenter degrees of freedom enter the picture, and regrets creep in about what wasn't included in the study or about how something was overlooked. There are often facets of experiments and analyses scientists think they understand, and they do in a vague way, but they don't actually consider the concrete details until it's too late. Writing out a a pre-registration helps you find design issues while they can still be fixed. The researcher forces themselves to examine the details of future analyses before committing to a design, thereby improving the design itself. This makes the research more efficient and useful and streamlines the study in the process. Thinking of including a questionnaire? Without pre-reg, I would just include it. With pre-reg, I think about WHY I might to include it, what analyses I might run, what it would look like in a published paper, and what reviewers might think about it. Pre-registration makes research more conscious. Pre-registration makes me think of better study designs. By thinking ahead and considering the analysis and publication, I am emboldened to revise my design to make it better: more efficient, more useful, more understandable, more ambitious. I am more likely to build a clever design where I can get multiple pre-registrations and thus multiple publications from a single study design. When it comes time to run the analysis, it is so easy if you have a pre-registration! It's all right there, decided by your past self. A pre-registration is a gift to your future self. A pre-registration is quintessentially delayed gratification. The hardest part about pre-registration is forcing yourself to work now when you could leave it to later. The pay-off is worth it, though. While I think the field needs to ease up on some fronts (e.g. we should be doing power analyses but we should not be held to the highest standard of doing the most advanced predictive modelling for power analysis; something simple should suffice to indicate we have at least enough power, especially if we collect well above the sample size indicated by a modest power analysis) I think the field should push for more pre-registration. Anything that isn't pre-registered is untrustworthy. It is simply too easy for researchers to selectively report and to fool themselves into thinking their research is robust because a p-value is low. Most researchers don't understand p-values anyway. regarding data-management: I don't think pre-registration is intrinsically tied to open materials and open data, but they often go together. As such, I don't really have anything to say about pre-registration's effects on data-management other than this: by thinking through analysis ahead of time, pre-registration ensures you collect the necessary data.

44	My experience with preregistration has been relatively positive. Honestly, I do not see much difference between studies that I preregister vs. those that I do not. The only difference is that extra step of red-tape needed before data collection can begin. This can be somewhat annoying, and is often a barrier to preregistration for me. Nevertheless, I support the effort to encourage preregistration. My only concern is that eventually there will just be too many preregistrations for a person to ever look through. I would rather see this technique used strategically (e.g., to confirm initially unexpected findings with an a priori preregistered follow-up) rather than a standard “always preregister everything” practice. I could be persuaded though.	01	Honestly, I do not see much difference between studies that I preregister vs. those that I do not.

46	Honestly, preregistration has not changed my workflow much. I already specify materials, measures, hypothesis, and analysis plans at the point of IRB submission, so now I just repeat that on OSF. I could probably be better about uploading analysis code earlier in the process, but I usually do the coding and de-identify the data prior to uploading those to OSF at the time of manuscript submission.  Plus, I have no problem reporting changes to preregistered plans based on unanticipated outcomes of the research process (and I report exploratory analysis as such). My undergraduate students (in both research methods/upper-division lab classes and those who work in my lab for credit) have also easily adapted to preregistration. Because I work at an exclusively undergraduate institution, preregistered REPORTS are a no-go for me because the delay between planning and executing would significantly impact the way students engage in the research process.	01	Honestly, preregistration has not changed my workflow much.

47	Workflow: As compared to not pre-registering, pre-registered resulted in a more linear or at least organized workflow. It focused us on the core analysis that would be done on the study, made sure these analyses were feasible, given the design and measures, and probably saved us time in terms of cutting down on extra analysis or having to iterate  Data management: As far as data management goes, for the particular projects we were working on (simple between condition lab or survey experiments), pre-registering didn't change much about data management -- aside from, as I mentioned above (perhaps in the wrong section), cutting down on the collection of unnecessary data, making sure we were collecting the right data, and reducing unnecessary or uninformative analyses. Quality of research: I think pre-registering our study definitely resulted in high quality confirmatory research. Our goal for the studies we were pre-registering was to be clear about effect we were specifying and increase our audience's confidence that this is a genuine effect. For these goals, I think pre-registration was effective. (One slight thought I'll mention is I now feel an obligation to pre-register all the studies I conduct. Nothing is really restricted by this, as I can always go beyond the pre-registration and simply make it clear I did so. However, I have wondered if always starting from a place of specifying the main analyses/analyses that will be central from the outset limits/constricts the types of studies I conduct or datasets I explore. It's possible that purposefully doing some highly unplanned, very exploratory analyses can sometimes lead to insights, new ideas, ideas for then more specific analyses that wouldn't have been arrived if always starting from a place of pre-registration. Also perhaps if I were to always pre-register, I would be less likely to try out methods I am less familiar with, because I am less sure of how to specify what I want to do--which I would otherwise kind of learn along the way. I recognize that this is a bit of a false dichotomy. But in practice, it is possible that a shift towards pre-registration does results in some of these changes/re-prioritizations. Just a dumb/half-formed thought.)	01	Workflow: As compared to not pre-registering, pre-registered resulted in a more linear or at least organized workflow.

48	During the past three years, I have preregistered all my studies. However, based on the aims of a study, the preregistration could differ (we chose a platform to preregister based on how strict guidelines for preregistration are). Overall, I don’t think that I would have conducted the studies differently without preregistration. However, it gives you credibility when you decide to do some non-standard things beforehand. Furthermore, when analyzing data, and results are not really what you expected, I usually make a clear distinction in research reports between what we preregistered and post-hoc, exploratory analyses. This might also be clearer for the reader than without the preregistration. As disadvantages: it takes more time and you need to think about certain things beforehand (but this is not necessarily a bad thing). Overall: no differences in workflow (except a bit more time) and data management, and quality is identical or better when using preregistrations.	01	Overall, I don’t think that I would have conducted the studies differently without preregistration.

49	Preregistration made the workflow of my study easier by providing a centralized documentation that I can rely on to create stimuli and procedure. For non-preregistered research, a lot of time is spent for trial-and-error process to design the experiment. For my preregistered project, I had to go through this process beforehand to create a preregistration document, which worked well for me, and I believe eventually improved the overall methodology and quality of the study.	01	Preregistration made the workflow of my study easier by providing a centralized documentation that I can rely on to create stimuli and procedure.
