1	In 2014, I started to preregister all of my confirmatory studies and develop these studies with the intention to share the data. Preregistration and data sharing have improved my research. My workflow is more transparent (though there is much scope for improvement), and I manage my data better (e.g., labelling variables, documenting data processing decisions).	01	Preregistration and data sharing have improved my research.

3	I generally do preregistrations for all of my studies these days, so the only way for me to respond to this would be to compare it to collaborations led by others (which are not always preregistered) and what I used to do before I started preregistering. The biggest difference is that more of the burden of writing up the design and analyses/analysis plan is put on the front end. This also means that I generally spend considerably more time carefully thinking through my design, how it corresponds to my hypotheses, and precisely how I will test my hypotheses/what would constitute confirmation before launching the study. I feel that all of this has dramatically improved the quality of my work, which is why I have transitioned to preregistering virtually all of my studies at this point.	01	The biggest difference is that more of the burden of writing up the design and analyses/analysis plan is put on the front end.

4	Having pre-registered nearly every study I’ve run in my graduate career, I can say that pre-registration has personally helped me organize my projects and have an easy repository to find old data and materials (I am not always the most organized with my personal computer workflow). Ultimately, pre-registration has not only made my research more consistent and better planned, but also assisted with manuscript writing since a good bulk of the methods section(s) is essentially complete before starting. One downside for me is that sometimes pre-registration can promote a feeling of obligation to continue with projects that are not going to be fruitful or that I’ve simply lost passion for, merely because I’ve publicly “promised” via pre-registration that I would complete something and have results to show for it.	01	I can say that pre-registration has personally helped me organize my projects and have an easy repository to find old data and materials (I am not always the most organized with my personal computer workflow).

5	the main differences between pre-registered endnote pre-registered studies was for me: thinking more carefully about study designs due to the prompts of the pre-registration forms (e.g. I never thought about the power of a simple CFA before pre-registering a study with a CFA); avoiding unintended HARKing in pre-registered studies; becoming more clear about the own methodological strength and weaknesses while pre-registering	01	the main differences between pre-registered endnote pre-registered studies was for me: thinking more carefully about study designs due to the prompts of the pre-registration forms (e.g. I never thought about the power of a simple CFA before pre-registering a study with a CFA)	NA

7	I love preregistering. I haven't tried publishing a 'preregistered report' because I think this would disrupt my flow of data collection, but I do ensure that my publications reflect the preregistration and account for any deviations. As a vision scientist, the pre-registration more aware of the need to properly pilot the experiment before running real participants (for example, finding the best stimulus intensities and number of trials). I make sure to set out my main hypotheses and the appropriate comparisons, if I get lost in data exploration I return to the preregistration to remind myself what the aims were originally. I also feel more confident rejecting participants from further analysis because I preregister criteria for rejection (for example, for chance level performance). When it comes to writing up, I take the preregistered methods and change future tense to past, and that way I don't waste time because I forgot some detail such as monitor resolution.	01	As a vision scientist, the pre-registration more aware of the need to properly pilot the experiment before running real participants (for example, finding the best stimulus intensities and number of trials).

8	I have now done a couple of preregistered studies, and I did not experience much differences with the non-preregistered ones. It probably helped me to think more critically about the analysis beforehand, having to write it down explicitly, but the other steps were not much different in my experience. One disadvantage that I experienced was during the review process, where I got a comment about the preregistration, which I would otherwise not have received.	01	It probably helped me to think more critically about the analysis beforehand, having to write it down explicitly	NA

9	To me pre-registration is a bit like chess: you have to think about a lot of potential “moves” in advance (different aspects of the design, how participants might react, what to do if you have a lot of missing values, violations of assumptions, etc…). A lot of scenarios might never come to fruition just as your opponent in chess picks one particular line, and in that sense you may have wasted time thinking about all these alternatives. On the other hand, by carefully considering all these scenarios, you are ready for (almost) everything, and are less likely to make a fatal mistake (both in chess and in terms of panning and conducting a study). Also, the more experience you get, the better you become in anticipating different moves. So, my workflow is different: with pre-reg (almost) every design choice, and analysis pipeline is specified before the data collection (except for pilot data), whereas my non pre-reg work is more loosely specified. Note that pre-reg versus non-pre-reg correlates with my maturation as a researcher. So even though the data-management of my pre-reg work is better on average, I can’t say it’s because of pre-reg. If I would have to guess, it’s more about focusing on transparency in general that led me to improve my data-management and pre-reg confirmatory work. Disclaimer: I also teach about pre-reg, so I’m probably biased; also, you might get some socially desirable responses seeing that you are pre-reg advocates yourselves (if I’m not mistaken). Anyway, good luck with the project. Let me know if you need any additional information.	01	To me pre-registration is a bit like chess: you have to think about a lot of potential “moves” in advance (different aspects of the design, how participants might react, what to do if you have a lot of missing values, violations of assumptions, etc…).

10	workflow: For pre-registered studies, I make sure I the analysis script is ready -- or almost ready -- before starting data collection.

11	In my experience, pre-registered studies are more work up-front: work that during my training I would have done during data analysis and writing. Some of this work affects the ideal study design, so it's better for that reason that it's earlier in the process. Additionally, I'm convinced it leads to better inference because of the interpretability of p-values. Finally, I feel it lends credibility to the eventual results and manuscripts. So: workflow is front-ended, but not overall more. Data management: because I expect others to see it, I use more reproducible methods and better code, and that probably helps me more than anyone. In terms of quality of research, I find it is higher, in general.	01	pre-registered studies are more work up-front: work that during my training I would have done during data analysis and writing.

12	I don’t find any noticeable difference in the amount of work required for a preregistered vs. a non-preregistered project, rather it’s mainly just a matter of doing things in a different order. Specifically one needs to write the methods/procedure text before instead of after data collection. I can’t really think of any differences in terms of data management. In terms of quality, obviously it makes a big difference, for example by forcing one to test a larger sample than might otherwise be the case, and tying one’s hands in terms of data mining.	01	In terms of quality, obviously it makes a big difference, for example by forcing one to test a larger sample than might otherwise be the case, and tying one’s hands in terms of data mining.

13	Here are my experiences with respect to your questions: - Workflow: Preregistrations (should) have a higher standard of writing than personal project notes of non-preregistered projects. The necessity to write a preregistration before data collection begins slows these projects down. At least in my experience, the preregistration documents cannot be recycled for the paper. Otherwise, the workflow is independent of the presence of a preregistration. - Data management: I am a proponent of open science and make as much material from my projects available as possible, in the most useful format possible. Therefore, there are no differences between preregistered and non-preregistered studies. - Quality of research: I do not see a difference in the quality of research between preregistered and not-preregistered projects and I do not decide whether to preregister or not based on the quality of the research question.	01	The necessity to write a preregistration before data collection begins slows these projects down.

16	Pre-registration generally streamlines the workflow and makes things go faster; this is because there are many fewer exploratory analyses to consider, so there is objectively less data analysis to conduct. The data management is about the same for me, as I am relatively meticulous about data management regardless of whether or not I preregister. The quality of the research is mixed; on one hand, preregistration makes the preregistered analysis more trustworthy for reasons I'm sure you're well aware of. However, the peer review process suggested an alternative analysis strategy which was, frankly, better than what I had originally preregistered. I reported it as an exploratory analysis, but it did suggest to me that preregistering a subpar analysis might not lead to high quality research. Presumably registered reports would partially mitigate this issue. So preregistration was a net positive for quality, but has potential pitfalls if it is rushed.	01	Pre-registration generally streamlines the workflow and makes things go faster; this is because there are many fewer exploratory analyses to consider, so there is objectively less data analysis to conduct.

17	I have pre-registered three projects, of which two are registered reports. I thought that I got better each time at dealing with the process - and I definitely prefer registered reports to pre-registration, as it allows us to improve design based on reviewer feedback. Workflow: I think workflow is improved by pre-registration, both for students and for me! It forces us to set clear and addressable hypotheses. It also forces to confront issues of power early on. Data management: I don’t think that pre-registration changes how I manage data, although the need to make data open access does lead to better data curation. Quality of research: Pre-registration doesn’t allow you to delude yourself about the pattern of results that you get. This is more of a danger than we believe it is. For my BMC Psychology paper, I remember thinking my results were entirely in line with what I expected, only to go back to my pre-registration and see they were not the hypotheses I specified.	01	I think workflow is improved by pre-registration, both for students and for me	NA

17	I have pre-registered three projects, of which two are registered reports. I thought that I got better each time at dealing with the process - and I definitely prefer registered reports to pre-registration, as it allows us to improve design based on reviewer feedback. Workflow: I think workflow is improved by pre-registration, both for students and for me! It forces us to set clear and addressable hypotheses. It also forces to confront issues of power early on. Data management: I don’t think that pre-registration changes how I manage data, although the need to make data open access does lead to better data curation.

18	Here is my perspective: I strongly support pre-registration and the adoption of other methodological innovations (new and not so new) that help increase the confidence in research and our fields of science. Pre-registration forces me to develop more materials up front, writing the hypotheses, methods, and analyses sections as they would appear in an eventual manuscript. This takes considerable time, I am very busy and work on a wide variety of projects, so I usually have to write new material. I do not have the time to pre-register everything, so I tend to pre-register projects that I am excited about and believe are theoretically innovative. I tend not to pre-register exploratory studies or ones where the results are not surprising and add incrementally to an established literature. The benefits of pre-registration to my own work quality is that I have to clearly specify the hypotheses and make clear connections among the hypotheses, methods, and analyses before data collection. Sometimes I have an idea and add a new measure at the beginning of data collection, after I have pre-registered the project. I describe this appropriately in the manuscript and have not had any problematic issues with reviewers on this.	01	Pre-registration forces me to develop more materials up front, writing the hypotheses, methods, and analyses sections as they would appear in an eventual manuscript.

19	Our pre-defined (and properly powered) recruitment targets have made the workflow far easier to manage than our non-preregistered studies - these fundamental aspects of experimental design are no longer simply guess-work. Data analysis scripts are now coded up before we get the final datasets, and analysis is performed within an afternoon rather than spending months searching for significant findings.

20	"Workflow: It seems like preregistration has helped me to ""front-load"" project work, such that I spend more time thinking about how the hypothesis to be tested relates to the study design and analysis plan before the data are collected. In my experience, this has caused an increase in the quality of my work. Specifically, tightening the link between data - informative study design - informative analysis plan. However, I also completed my PhD and have learned a lot in academia at the same time as I've learned to use preregistration, so it's hard to evaluate the counterfactual (i.e., would my work be slightly less improved now if I'd never used preregistration - hard to tell). Data management: To be honest, the type of preregistration I've used (hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans) has not really affected the way I approach data management. That is, even in projects where preregistration hasn't been used, my data curating and sharing practices have been much the same. Quality of research: I guess I already addressed how preregistration has improved the quality of my work in the heading ""workflow"". I would like to report a negative experience about my use of preregistration (where it made the quality of my work actively worse), but honestly I can't think of any. The only downside to preregistration that I've experienced is cases where I've preregistered a suboptimal analysis plan (and this coming to light after data collection), resulting in me noting this sub-optimality in the writing up of the project for publication.

I find it hard to believe I would've thought any harder in the absence of preregistration, so I don't judge this as negatively affecting the quality of my work.

21	Due to the written (rather than just verbal) discussions and the opportunity to get their name on a preregistration, PIs and collaborators get more involved in the beginning of the conduction of the study. This ensures that the study is thoroughly discussed with an expert before it is conducted. Regarding the workflow: we now have a table of hypotheses and related planned analyses before testing. After testing we then conduct exactly those analyses and add a field with results to this very same table. This way we can ensure that we conduct every analysis we planned and that, if we decide to conduct additional tests, these are clearly marked as exploratory. I believe that the quality has improved in the sense that researcher degree of freedom are minimized. There may be quality problems if the preregistration did not initially choose the best analysis method (these can be solved with better preregistrations – we got better over time ;) – or by conducting additional exploratory analyses).	01	Due to the written (rather than just verbal) discussions and the opportunity to get their name on a preregistration, PIs and collaborators get more involved in the beginning of the conduction of the study.

22	Workflow: Pro: Pre-registration forces you to be precise in your thinking and measurement and creates commitment for the researcher. Con: Working with pre-registration typically takes much longer for two reasons: 1) there’s additional administrative stuff that needs to be done (e.g., filling in forms etc.) which takes a lot of time and reduces productivity compared to people who don’t do it, 2) it is more costly to do research because studies have to be run multiple times. Data management: There’s not much difference in my experience. I aim to upload data and materials to OSF anyway. Quality of research: Pro: Pre-reg reduces the likelihood of using false positives in your research because it forces you to use fewer measures. Con: Pre-reg (the way it’s currently propagated) is not very practical for complex samples (e.g., ESM studies, multi-wave studies, costly professional samples) where the hypothesis is not always clear in advance and you only have one opportunity to collect all the measures you suspect could be affected.	01	Pre-registration forces you to be precise in your thinking and measurement and creates commitment for the researcher	NA

23	I have noted the following differences with regard to my experience with studies that are preregistered vs not preregistered: Compared to studies that were not preregistered, in preregistered studies: -I spent more time thinking about the expected effect size (or smallest effect size of interest) before doing analyses, which is related to the fact that I did more detailed power analyses in preregistered studies. -I shift more of the work to the stage before data-collection/analyses, but save time doing and reporting the analyses. -I Feel more confident about my decisions during the analytic process. Deviating from the original planned analyses feels less wrong, because of the requirement to report the deviations. This transparency reduces my fear of making decisions because of confirmation bias without others being able to evaluate my decisions. -Related, preregistrations, helped me keeping track of which tests were confirmatory and which analyses were exploratory. Without a preregistration, this distinction may be hard to make, especially when work on the paper spans several months or years. It is easy to forget which analyses were planned, and which were carried out after initial data analyses.	01	I spent more time thinking about the expected effect size (or smallest effect size of interest) before doing analyses, which is related to the fact that I did more detailed power analyses in preregistered studies.

24	Since 2017, I have pre-registered every study on which I am lead or senior author. I think pre-registered studies are planned more thoroughly before data are collected. For example, it makes it easier for power analyses to be conducted, because the precise data-analytical approach is decided before data are collected. As we are juggling multiple projects, I find pre-registration improves my management of projects; at any time I can refer to the pre-reg document to remind myself of our approach and hypotheses. I don’t find any difference in the management of the empirical data collected. In terms of quality, I think when our a priori predictions are supported, the findings are more compelling (than if we had not pre-registered). This is because it signals to others that these were indeed the effects that we predicted at the outset. From observing the work of others, however, I think it is important that the pre-registration is considered and contains enough information such that people can assess if the pre-reg was followed. Basically, I think that the quality of the pre-reg is very important, and sometimes this can take a long time. Saying that, once the details of the pre-reg are considered, this can speed up the writing and analysis when the data are collected (the hard work determining analytical approach has already been completed).	01	I think pre-registered studies are planned more thoroughly before data are collected.

25	Pre-registration has smoothed my workflow by forcing me to plan my research to a much finer degree than before. Regarding data analysis, the planning stage has also facilitated a habit of data simulation, so I can pre-register my R code. This is incredibly valuable. Regarding data management, it has made no obvious impact. I believe the quality of my research has been greatly enhanced. I find holding myself accountable very valuable. I also find it incredibly useful to protect my work against post-hoc reviewers (#notallreviewers, of course), but there's always some who tell me (and my colleagues) that the hypotheses don't match the data. A pre-reg document is useful in that situation. (However, I am happy to yield to superior analyses if suggested by a reviewer, with full declaration, of course). I've also found it useful to have my junior colleagues in ... less ideal labs ... to pre-register their projects, to avoid old-school researchers asking them to be selective in their reporting, or to make claims (wilfully, or forgetfully) about certain hypotheses or planned analyses.	01	Pre-registration has smoothed my workflow by forcing me to plan my research to a much finer degree than before.

Regarding data analysis, the planning stage has also facilitated a habit of data simulation, so I can pre-register my R code. This is incredibly valuable. Regarding data management, it has made no obvious impact. I believe the quality of my research has been greatly enhanced. I find holding myself accountable very valuable. I also find it incredibly useful to protect my work against post-hoc reviewers (#notallreviewers, of course), but there's always some who tell me (and my colleagues) that the hypotheses don't match the data. A pre-reg document is useful in that situation. (However, I am happy to yield to superior analyses if suggested by a reviewer, with full declaration, of course). I've also found it useful to have my junior colleagues in ... less ideal labs ... to pre-register their projects, to avoid old-school researchers asking them to be selective in their reporting, or to make claims (wilfully, or forgetfully) about certain hypotheses or planned analyses.	02	Regarding data analysis, the planning stage has also facilitated a habit of data simulation, so I can pre-register my R code.
