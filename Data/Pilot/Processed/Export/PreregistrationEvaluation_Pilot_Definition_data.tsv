group	definition
confidence about the analysis	being more confident about preset exclusion criteria; more confident in own decisions during analysis
considerateness	more clear connection between the data, design and the analysi plan; more clear connection between the hypotheses, the desgin, and the analysis; more precise in thinking and measurement; more thought through and detaild analysis; more thought through plan; more thought through study
preparedness	added habit of data simulation; analysis script is ready before data collection; more detailed plan; more developed study upfront; more planned workflow, data management, study design
project organizedness	better organized study; better organized team work; improves project management
project time economy	can speed up the study; different workflow but saves time in the long run; faster analysis; makes the project faster; more time consuming but more accurate; more time spent on planning; more time to run the study because of extra administrative steps; slows the project down
quality control	every collaborator on the study discusses the study before datacollection
quality of data management	better data management; improved data management
quality of hypotheses	more clear hypotheses
quality of the study design	better study design; fewer measures because of preregistration; higher powered study; make you have larger sample size; more consistent and better planned study; more precise power analysis; more rigorous study plan; more specified design and analysis; potentially worse quality if not the best analysis method was preregistered; quality can be worse if someone preregisters a poor analysis method; study design more thought through; study is more thought through before data collection
smoothness of workflow	clearer research process; easier to write the manuscript; improved workflow; more transparent workflow
temptation of QRP	helps avoid harking; helps avoid unintentional harking
work related stress	negative comment by the reviewer; obligation to finish a poor study idea; preregistering suboptimal analysis, that leads to emberassement when it has to be written down in the paper; project more organized
